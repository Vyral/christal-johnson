The AJ Team had another fantastic year in 2020. Despite the uncertainty that COVID-19 brought to our market (and our world), our team sold 195 homes in 2020. Our total sales volume was $83 million, and we&nbsp;**were able to donate over $68,000 in revenue to relief efforts**&nbsp;in our community. Thank you so much for your support and trust this year. We’re still here to handle all your real estate needs in 2021, and the best is yet to come.&nbsp;

If you have any real estate needs that we can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
