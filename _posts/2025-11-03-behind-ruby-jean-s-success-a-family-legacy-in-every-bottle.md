For many people, living a healthy lifestyle can feel difficult, especially when not-so-healthy choices are a lot more convenient and comes with a cheaper price. But it all comes to changing long-time habits.. Ruby Jean’s Juicery, founded by Chris Goode in Kansas City, offers a simple and easy way to improve your health through fresh, cold-pressed juice.

**But the story behind Ruby Jean’s is about more than just a business;** it’s about family, legacy, and taking control of your health in a meaningful way.

Chris’s journey into the world of juicing started with his grandmother, Ruby Jean. Growing up, Ruby Jean was the heart of his family, showing love through soul food like fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread. However, as Chris grew older, he saw the toll these foods took on her health.

After losing both his grandmother and great-grandmother in a short period of time, Chris realized the importance of making healthier choices. This experience led him to start Ruby Jean’s Juicery, a business that honors his family’s legacy while promoting better health.
