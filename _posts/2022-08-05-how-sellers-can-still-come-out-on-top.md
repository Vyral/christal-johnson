Are you wondering how selling in the housing market has changed lately? We have been getting questions about this a lot. Things have shifted in our market, and we want to help you be ready to sell your home in today’s conditions.&nbsp;

The first thing to consider is that **pricing strategy matters more now than ever before.** The sellers who see the most success are selling their homes a little bit lower than the last active comps. They’re getting multiple offers and ending up with more money because of the lower price. When you think about pricing your home, ensure you have an aggressive strategy, and ask yourself who you are pricing your home for. An investor? A first-time homebuyer? Factors change depending on who will be moving in.

A second thing to think about is that **presentation matters.** Remember that buyers don’t have much money for fixing things because they’re dealing with higher interest rates and prices. Therefore, you need to ensure that when they walk into your home, those buyers feel like it’s ready. We have a stager on our team that walks sellers through everything to avoid any qualms from buyers.&nbsp;

**Overall, the crucial thing when trying to sell a home is to understand buyers’ mindset.** Buyers have to worry about higher interest rates, which means they are more sensitive to higher prices and the property’s condition. Therefore, you want to make sure that your home exudes confidence.&nbsp;
