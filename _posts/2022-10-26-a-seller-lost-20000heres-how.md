We're in a market now where pricing your home is a bit trickier than it used to be compared to this time last year. Today I'm going to tell you **a quick story about the true cost of pricing your home wrong**.

In April, we had a seller who we met with and we told them that their home was worth $370,000. The seller decided to listen to himself and price their home at $400,000—reaching for a price and also thinking folks will offer a little less than the listing price. By the time we hit July, we had 50 showings and zero offers. The seller then adjusted his price to $370,000. The only problem was that April’s price was no longer July’s price. In August, that same home sold for $360,000.

Now, many will say the seller only lost $10,000. However, if you add up the five months of holding costs, that equals an additional $10,000. So **the seller lost a total of $20,000** by deciding to listen to himself and not the professional.&nbsp;
