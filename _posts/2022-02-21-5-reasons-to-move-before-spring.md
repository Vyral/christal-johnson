Many buyers in today’s market are waffling over whether they should buy a home now or wait until the spring market when there will likely be more homes for sale. Yes, inventory is low, and there will be an influx of available properties as we near the spring, but today I’ll share **five good reasons you should not wait until the spring to buy a home:**

**1\. New builds are delayed.** Many people who have put homes under contract with new builders have expected to settle on a specific date, only to have that date pushed back due to supply chain issues. People are having similar issues with contractors, as well.

**2\. Getting a head start in this market is mandatory.** We are dealing with arguably one of the most complex real estate markets we’ve dealt with over the last four or five years; we’re still hot, but conditions are changing. It’s critical to get a head-start so that you can be fully prepared.

**3\. Buying now gives you time to recalibrate.** Many people who start out in this market think they want one thing, but later realize they need time to figure things out before they’re comfortable moving forward. If you start the process earlier, you’ll have more time to recalibrate before the buying frenzy starts.

**4\. You can avoid the frenzy.** Many people are thinking about buying homes, whether they’re selling their old ones to buy new or they’re making the jump to homeownership for the first time. If you want to avoid the fierce competition the spring market will present, you need to be ready before the market activity begins to pick up momentum.

**5\. The perfect house never aligns with your perfect timeline.** You never know when the perfect home for you is going to hit the market, so it’s better to prepare yourself early to leap on it as quickly as it appears if you want the best chance of getting it.

If you have any questions about buying a home or getting ready to enter the market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you gear up for success, whatever your real estate goals are. Hope to hear from you soon\!
