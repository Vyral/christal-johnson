Today we’re excited to bring you this interview with Estefany Argueta. She was previously our wonderful listing coordinator for about a year and has newly transitioned into the role of Buyer Specialist!

**What are two things that people don’t know about her?** She has a ten-year-old sister, and she came to this country when she was 12.

**What would she tell her younger self if she had the chance?** She would say that she’s going to be fine and to slow down.

**Does she prefer beer, wine, or liquor?** Definitely wine.

**Tacos or Pizza?** Tacos.

**Would she rather have a penthouse in Arlington or a mansion in Woodbridge?** She would choose the mansion because she is all about space.

**Beach, mountains, or lake?** This one is difficult for her since she wants both mountains and a lake.

**If she could move anywhere outside of the DMV, where would it be?** North Carolina. She likes the people, the slow pace, and the overall Southern culture.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

**Why our team?** We allow her to be herself. She can be creative, and we help her become a little bit better every single day.

**What does she love about real estate?** She loves that there’s never a dull moment. There’s always a challenge she must overcome in using her story to make a difference in the community.

**Why would she be the best Realtor in the DMV?** She cares, is always learning, finds ways to get things done, and is part of a team that has a system for success. She lives by the quote from Philippians 4:13—”I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.”&nbsp;
