Welcome to this week’s edition of “AJ Eats.”&nbsp;

This week we’re visiting Presto\! Pizza—a great family-owned restaurant in Lake Ridge where I had the chance to meet up with two of the owners. Pat, his mother Pina, and their family started Presto\! back in December of 2007.&nbsp;

Since then, they’ve held a philosophy that’s kept people coming back seven years later. Pat says that it’s all about freshness. But using quality ingredients for their pizzas and homemade sauce is just part of what they do.

Everyone here at Presto\! Pizza has a true commitment to creating connections. Family is important to them, and they treat their customers like family.

Whenever I call in, Pat remembers not only my name, but also my favorite pizza—pepperoni and sausage. He says this extra effort is important, and they put it into the way they treat people and the way they make their food, as well.

I’ve always loved the pizza here, but today I got the chance to do something different and actually go inside the kitchen. With Pat’s help, I even got to make my very own version of my favorite pizza. It all starts with rolling out the ball of dough.&nbsp;

Using one hand as a guide and using one to mold, we shaped the dough out into a crust. Next, we added a sprinkle of flour before flipping the dough over and stretching it even more. From the beginning of the process, it was easy to see the level of care that goes into the food here. Every pizza is hand-stretched, hand-tossed, and hand-topped every time.&nbsp;

After we evenly spread out the homemade sauce, we added parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Finally, it came time for the toppings. Because Presto\! Pizza has the best pizza in Lake Ridge, I arranged the toppings on the one I made into an “LR.”&nbsp;

The reason Presto\! Pizza is the best isn’t just about the quality of their food, it’s also about the love they put into the restaurant. You absolutely can’t go wrong with coming here. I definitely recommend that you check it out. But don’t just take my word for it.

While I was in the restaurant I took the chance to interview Dominic, another member of the AJ team, about why he’s always here at Presto\! Pizza. As someone with Italian heritage himself, Dominic says it’s worth coming back for.&nbsp;

We here at the AJ team love to help out local businesses, so if you decide to come out to Presto\! and give it a try, be sure to tell them we sent you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
