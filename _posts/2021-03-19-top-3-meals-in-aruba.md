In today's video, I’m coming to you live from Aruba to show you the three places you have to eat in and the menu items you need to try.

The first is Yemanja, located downtown behind the Renaissance Hotel. My favorite meal here is the skirt steak. When you come here, ask for Kevin, then ask Kevin for the skirt steak. **Check it out at 0:50 in the video above.**

Next, we’re off to Wacky Wahoo’s. They cook all fish well, but they have some of the best grouper I’ve ever had. What my wife loves about it is that it comes out piping hot and delicious. **Check it out at 1:44 in the video above.**

Finally, we’re at Craft and Lola. They have two things that we love here: The nachos and the Korean fried chicken sandwich. It has a great outdoor vibe too, as you can see in the video at 2:05.

If you need more recommendations for Aruba or have any real estate-related questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
