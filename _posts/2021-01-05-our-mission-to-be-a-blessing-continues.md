As you know, one of AJ Team Realty’s core values is “be a blessing,” and we recently partnered with friend and social worker Erin Hancock to identify 12 local families we could collectively bless this holiday season with gift cards, cash, and prayers. Today Erin joins me to give an update on this initiative and the tremendous response we’ve gotten. Our goal was to raise $10,000 through our nonprofit organization, Be a Blessing Foundation, Inc., but we’ve exceeded that goal. All the while, Erin has been crisscrossing Prince William County doing wonderful work.

<br>As I’ve said before, **if you’d like to be involved in this outreach in an ongoing manner, feel free to reach out to Erin directly.** This is NOT about the AJ Team...this is about God’s work and us collectively being His hands and feet. Thank you.
