Today I want to discuss a topic that’s on a lot of people’s minds: buying and selling a home at the same time. We have crazy low inventory right now, so it’s easy to sell your house. However, what do you do after? You have options, and I want to go over some of them with you today.&nbsp;

Generally, there are four ways to make an offer on a home before selling your old one. First, you buy with an offer contingent on putting your home on the market; second, you can make an offer contingent on your home going under contract; third, you can make an offer contingent on your home going into settlement; finally, you can make an offer that isn’t contingent on your home selling at all. **The best offer is one that isn’t contingent on your sale.** This isn’t an option for everyone, but if you can do it, it’s your best bet.&nbsp;

Once you decide which of these four options is best for you, there are a few things you can do to make the process go smoothly. First, get your home ready months in advance. If your offer is contingent on a sale, you need to let your seller know that they won’t have to wait around forever while you get your property market ready.&nbsp;

Next, talk with your lender. You may be able to write a non-contingent offer. If you can, it will give you a huge leg up over the competition and make the buying and selling process much easier.&nbsp;

You may also want to consider a rent-back agreement. When you sell your home, you can negotiate with your buyer to rent your property back for a set period of time. This should give you time to shop for your new home from the comfort of your old one.&nbsp;

Finally, understand that you’re buying and selling in the same market. **The same advantages you have as a seller are the disadvantages you’ll face as a buyer.** Make sure you work with an experienced agent who understands your needs and how to meet them.&nbsp;
