Did you ever think that you might assume a 2.5% mortgage in an 7% world? With a little preparation, that could be your reality.

During this fascinating interview, we discovered that, by paying a little more every month and building their equity, one lucky homeowner was able to do just that. It was all made possible with preparation and the help of a trusted local real estate agent. **This homeowner could never have been able to finance a home in an 7% interest rate environment if it weren’t for the power of assumable loans and an AJ Team Realtor.**&nbsp;

The process wasn’t complicated, although it was different from your standard home purchase. That’s what makes a qualified real estate agent so invaluable. It was made all the more possible because of the commitment of our agent to making this dream come true.
