I hear this question at least a few different times per week: “I want to get into real estate. What should I do?” My initial response is to think about the question a little more and then get back to me. However, I want to answer the question once and for all today.

There are two ways to “get into” the real estate business. The first is real estate sales. That’s what we do here every day on the AJ Team. We take clients out, help them find properties, and ultimately, our job is to sell.

Think of the highest pressure sales job you could ever think of, then add a layer of emotions on top, and multiply it by the fact that Northern Virginia is one of the craziest markets here in the U.S. I’d say that 99% of time when people say they want to get into real estate, this is not what they are talking about.

What most people are talking about when they say they want to get into real estate is actually real estate investing. That’s the other side of the ledger. Investors take their money, put it into properties, and watch it grow over time. Traditionally, this is the way that most people are looking to “get into” the real estate business.

If you want to get into real estate, start to think about which side you want to be on. When you’ve decided, we can help you get closer to achieving your goals by offering you advice and/or assistance. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
