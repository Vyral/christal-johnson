There are a couple of things that we are seeing in the real estate market right now, so I just wanted to quicklygo over some Prince William County stats.

To start with, the average sold price if finally up. Last month it made a 5% increase, which is pretty significantsince the six months, prior saw a decrease.

We are seeing a different market at $420,000 and up. If you are thinking about selling a home in that pricerange, the market reality is different above than below, so you need to make sure that you adjust accordingly.

768 homes sold last month in Prince William County, so it is still a very active market. For the first time, wehave seen active listings stay even. This means that there were no more new active listings or a large decrease inactive listings.

If you are thinking about selling, it is a good time to sell. You just need to make sure that you hit the marketcorrectly. Pricing right is important. Proper staging and renovations are also important. Finally, a prolongedmarketing system is crucial.

You have to prepare beyond the first week into the months that follow. You need to have a marketing planbecause your home may be sitting a little longer than what you anticipate.

If you have any questions or are thinking about selling or buying in our current market, please feel free toreach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
