To increase your referral business, it’s important that you know how to properly pass them on. Here are four tips to keep in mind.

Today Sam Eligwe is here with me to talk about a subject that’s very important for anyone in business: How to properly pass a referral. We’ve found four great tips that make passing that referral even easier, and we’re excited to share them with you today:

**1. Only refer those whom you believe in.** You only have one chance to get it right. You’re not just passing off a referral, you’re passing off your integrity, your judgment, and a lot of other things. If you are going to refer someone, make sure you get it right. The only way to get it right is with past experience. Identify a few things that you like about someone's professional skills after you work with them that you can tell to referrals.

**2. Look at what other business this referral has.** Not only is your experience important, but so is the experience of others who have worked with this person in the past.

**3. You don’t have to sell them.** Your confidence in your referral should speak for itself.

**4. Make the connection and let them handle their business.** Refer the business, and then you can step back and let things happen. Making that first contact is huge and gives your referral a much better shot of working with them. Word of mouth is huge for small businesses, so these referrals are very important.

Passing referrals off the right way is so important in our line of work. You can literally change businesses by referring the right way. If you have a referral for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. If you have any other questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
