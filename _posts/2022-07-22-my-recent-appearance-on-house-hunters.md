Have you ever heard of a TV show called “House Hunters”? I’m just kidding—of course you have\! Recently, I had the privilege of appearing in an episode where I helped an old sorority sister of mine buy a home in the Northern Virginia/Richmond area. It was a wild ride (just like these episodes usually are), but it was a ton of fun.&nbsp;

**Cherise was facing a choice that a lot of people are in today’s market.** Should she pay a premium for location? Should she expand her search area and find a better deal? Or should she skip the resale market altogether and go with a new build property? Each option has its pros and cons, and we worked through all of them together in this episode.&nbsp;

I hope you enjoy seeing how Cherise came to her decision. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call or email me with any questions. I am always willing to help\!

Would you like to be our next guest on House Hunters? &nbsp;If you are looking to move and think you would be great on television, **[let us know here\!](https://aj-team-tv.paperform.co/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**
