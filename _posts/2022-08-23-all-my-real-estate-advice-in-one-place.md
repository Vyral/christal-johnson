Do you watch a lot of HGTV and now want to buy or sell a home, invest in real estate, flip a house, or even become a real estate agent? Maybe you’re in the process of navigating one of these things but aren’t sure if you’re doing it right. Before you head to a hardware store, bid on a property, or study for your licensing exam, **you should get some no-nonsense education from an experienced real estate professional.**

Luckily, that professional is me\! My book, “50 Things Your Real Estate Agent Should Tell You But Probably Won't,” discusses all the facets of buying, selling, managing, and investing in real estate. If you have questions or want a thorough education about how real estate works, look no further than my book, which contains honest answers and tips from me, an award-winning real estate agent and industry insider.

The book is separated into eight easy-to-follow sections such as “How To Be a Smart Seller” and “Tackling Renovations and Repairs.” Each section has multiple chapters that cover specifics. For example, in the “Mastery of the Basics of Real Estate” section, there are chapters on finding your perfect piece of real estate, why you can’t time the market, how to get credit before you need credit, and more.&nbsp;

**Excerpt from the “Buyer Beware” section:**

*“Find an agent with whom you can be completely honest. You will need someone that will stick with you in the ups and downs of the process. Spending this much money is inherently stressful. Most people don’t handle the stress well. I give my clients permission to vent to me.”*

**Excerpt from the “How To Be a Smart Seller” section:**

*“Don’t take it personally. Once you put your home on the market, this is a business transaction. All the memories and great things you have done to your home may not be important to the next buyer. Get out of your feelings, step back, and make smart decisions.”*

I’ve had the honor and privilege of selling more than 1,000 homes and investing over $20 million in real estate. However, I’ve always been more concerned with teaching and learning real estate than selling it. That’s why I wrote this book—to share what I’ve learned through all my experience over the years.
