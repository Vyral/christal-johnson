The AJ Team mourns the loss of one of our clients, Meagan Radcliffe. She meant a lot to all of us, and we can’t believe she’s gone. So many fond memories, laughs, and joyous interactions with her have impacted not only my life, but the lives of everyone else on our team. You really don’t know how much people mean to you until they're gone. A [gofundme page](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2944951716670009718/7924079756830774464#){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has been organized to help her husband, Joey, and her daughters, Aubree and Everleigh, get through this unthinkable tragedy. To learn more about the life of Meagan Radcliffe and why she meant so much to all of us, watch my latest video.
