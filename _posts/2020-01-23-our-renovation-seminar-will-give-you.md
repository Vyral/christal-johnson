If you’re curious about what you can do to help your home sell for top dollar, our upcoming renovation seminar will be a huge help. Here’s what it will entail and how you can register for it.

Have you ever renovated a house to get it ready for sale? Do you know what you need to do to fix up, update, or repair your home before listing? Did you know that these decisions can either make or cost you thousands?

When you’re selling a home and renovating it, the profit is made well before you put the sign in the yard or accept the contract. The problem is that most agents don’t have the necessary experience to advise you on what to renovate.

While some sellers are worried about saving a percent or two on commission, smart sellers are preparing their home, making the correct renovations, and making thousands on their sale in profit.

We’ve helped many home sellers like you make thousands of dollars by getting their homes market-ready. We have a really special seminar coming up that will help you do the same.

Our FREE on-site renovation seminar will take you on a tour of a home that needs renovations from a to z. We’ll take you inside the strategy, the pricing, and the process of getting this home ready for the market and the decisions that will preserve your equity when you sell.

There are only 20 spots available for this hands-on tour with us, our contractors, and all the information that you will need when you decide to sell.

To register for one of our sessions, just follow this link. If you have any other questions about the seminar or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
