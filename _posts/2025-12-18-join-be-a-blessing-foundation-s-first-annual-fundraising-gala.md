If you have ever wondered how close real need really is, the truth is that it often sits right in our own neighborhoods. It doesn’t always show itself in obvious ways, but it affects families who are struggling to put food on the table, children who are trying to focus in school while worrying about where they will sleep that night, and parents facing sudden emergencies with no clear place to turn for help.

These challenges exist all around us, and once you recognize them, it becomes clear why action matters. This is exactly why we started the *Be a Blessing Foundation*.

The *Be a Blessing Foundation* is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit created to support families, children, and schools throughout Prince William County and the greater Northern Virginia area.

From the very beginning, our mission has been straightforward and intentional. **We wanted to step in when help is needed most, act quickly, and provide real support without unnecessary delays.** Our focus has always been on meeting urgent needs in a way that feels personal, respectful, and effective.

Over the years, the foundation has grown alongside the needs of our community. We have supported local schools, helped children through mentoring programs, assisted families during the holidays, and responded to both housing and food insecurity.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for help increased rapidly, and we expanded our efforts to ensure families had access to basic necessities. We also work closely with trusted local organizations such as ACTS Homeless Shelter and Streetlight Ministries to help keep food pantries stocked and critical resources available.

When a need comes in, we do not place it on a waiting list. Within 24 hours, we take action. Emergencies don’t wait, and families can’t afford long delays when they’re already under pressure.

Because of this approach and the continued support from our community, the foundation has donated nearly a quarter of a million dollars over the past five to seven years directly back into Prince William County and the surrounding Northern Virginia communities.

Now, we are taking an important next step and inviting you to be part of it.

**On January 16, we will be hosting the first annual** ***Be a Blessing Foundation*** **fundraising gala.** This black-tie evening will feature a Vegas night theme and is designed to bring people together around a shared purpose. There will be table games, music, food, and time to connect with others who believe in supporting the local community. Here’s a quick rundown of the event:

* **Event:** First Annual *Be a Blessing Foundation* Gala
* **Date:** Friday, January 16
* **Time:** 6:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.
* **Location:** Lorton, Virginia
* **Dress Code:** Black-tie attire
* **Theme:** Vegas Night

This gala is our largest fundraiser of the year, and every ticket purchased and every donation made directly support the foundation’s work. **All contributions, including tickets, are tax-deductible**, making this a meaningful option for those looking to make a year-end charitable contribution while having a direct impact on families and children in need.

**Attendance is encouraged, but it is not the only way to help.** Purchasing a ticket even if you cannot attend still supports the mission, and inviting friends, family members, coworkers, or neighbors helps extend our reach. The more people who get involved, the more quickly and effectively we can respond when needs arise.

**This event also carries special meaning, as it coincides with Allen’s 50th birthday.** His wish is simple and sincere. He wants to give back to the community that has supported him for so many years, and this gala is a way to celebrate that milestone while focusing on something far greater than one person.

No family should have to face an emergency alone, and no child should struggle through the day without basic support.

Your participation helps us continue responding quickly when real needs arise in our community.
