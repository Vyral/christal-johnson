Many homeowners consider selling their home without an agent. They look at the numbers and think, *“Why should we pay an agent when we can sell it ourselves?”* On the surface, it feels simple enough. You can post photos online, put up a sign, and wait for buyers to show up. The reality is different, because selling a home is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll ever make, and just because you can doesn’t mean you should.

**The market then vs. now.** A few years ago, almost anyone could sell a home. The market was so hot that even if you priced it wrong or skipped staging, buyers lined up anyway. The market corrected most mistakes because that’s not the case today, as mistakes cost real money now.

If the price is too high, your home may sit on the market for weeks with no activity. Negotiate the wrong way, and buyers will move on to other options. The current market is far less forgiving, which means preparation and strategy are more critical than ever.

**The value of a professional agent.** Uploading photos and scheduling showings is only the beginning. Experienced agents understand how to price correctly, how buyers are making decisions in real time, and how to manage negotiations that can make or break a deal.

Most buyers already have an agent representing them, which leaves unrepresented sellers at a clear disadvantage. Even though we’re licensed ourselves, when we own property outside our area, we hire local experts because we know the importance of professional guidance and local knowledge.

**Deals falling apart.** Here’s a fact that surprises many sellers: up to 20% of homes that go under contract never reach closing. Poor negotiations, inadequate preparation, or unrealistic expectations can lead to a deal collapsing. When that happens, sellers are left starting over, often at a lower price because buyers assume something must be wrong with the property. Mistakes like these are not only costly, they can delay your plans for months.

Selling your home affects more than your bottom line. A poorly managed sale by you or even a neighbor can bring down the value of the entire neighborhood. One bad decision can ripple through the block and reduce equity for everyone. That is why working with a skilled professional matters.
