With Thanksgiving right around the corner, today I wanted to bring you a list of the things that I’m most thankful for when it comes to our real estate market.&nbsp;

**First, I’m thankful that the DMV market is in a protective bubble of sorts**; agents that I talk to all over the country reiterate that we’re in a very advantageous place to do life, business, and real estate. A market slowdown in the DMV, for example, is very different from the slowdowns they have in Omaha or Louisville. In those places, home values would drop as soon as the market shifted. For us, we may just have homes sit on the market a little longer than normal or see a slight reduction in home appreciation. I’m very thankful that we’re in this real estate market, and it’s served us well this year.

**Another thing I’m thankful for is the diversity in our market and among our clients.** We get the opportunity to work with folks all over the world, and we are truly blessed to be able to do that.

I’m also very thankful for all of our clients and referral partners. In fact, **85% of the homes we will sell this year are from past clients and referrals.** Thanks for all of your support.

Next, I’m thankful that I get to work with an awesome team full of people who care more about the clients than the commission. Our team goes above and beyond to make the real estate experience exceptional for those who work with us.

**Finally, I’m thankful for our mission-driven real estate business.** We get to use this platform to serve, spread God’s love, and work in our purpose every day. Not everybody gets that opportunity, and we’re very thankful that we do.

If you have any questions for me or real estate needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Happy Thanksgiving\!
