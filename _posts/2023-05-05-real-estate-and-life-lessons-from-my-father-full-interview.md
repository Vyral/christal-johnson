Today, we’re bringing you something a little different than usual. We recently had the pleasure of interviewing someone with tons of wisdom who is more responsible than anyone for where we are today: My dad! We talked about what he thought when I first started in real estate, how I learned everything I know from him, marriage, and more.&nbsp;

**My dad had a lot to say about life, so I encourage you to listen to our interview when you have the time.** As always, don’t hesitate to reach out to us about real estate or any other topic. We look forward to hearing from you!
