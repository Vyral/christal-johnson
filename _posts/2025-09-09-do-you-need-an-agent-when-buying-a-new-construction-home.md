Think buying a new construction home is as simple as walking into the builder’s sales office? Well, that’s not always the case. Those friendly sales reps may seem helpful, but they work for the builder, not for you. Their job is to protect the builder’s profits, not your interests.

Without your own expert in your corner, you risk missing construction issues, signing one-sided contracts, or dealing with costly surprises after move-in. Don’t gamble with your biggest investment. Make sure you have the right protection from day one.

Today, **we’ll explain why having an agent matters when buying new construction**, how they protect you through every stage of the build, and what can happen when you go it alone. **Watch the video above or use the timestamps below to jump to the parts that interest you most:**
