How is it possible to get your offer accepted in a competitive market?

Imagine you’ve been searching for months and have finally found your dream home. Now you want to write an offer, but you can’t get the home.

This is a common problem. People think they can simply look at a home, write an offer, and prepare to move in. But this isn’t how it works. You need a game plan from the start if you want to win in this market.

On my team, we sit down with our clients to do just that. Today, I’d like to bring you a few tips for how we help our clients get their offers accepted.&nbsp;

First of all, research the home. Look at comparable properties, as well as trends for how things are selling in the area. Understanding what kinds of offers are being accepted is going to be a huge boost in writing your own.&nbsp;

The second best way to get your offer accepted is to work with a great, local lender. If the listing agent knows and trusts the lender you’re working with, you are going to have a competitive edge—even over near-identical offers.&nbsp;

Listing agents want to make sure that the lender behind the deal is solid and understands the local market.

Third, make sure you work with an experienced agent. My team has been in business for 17 years and our clients have definitely benefited from our experience. We’ve helped our clients win out even against offers where the seller would net more than they would from ours. This is because the listing agent has confidence in my team.

As a final bonus tip, I’d like to suggest that you tell the seller your story. Sometimes, money isn’t the biggest object. This tip won’t always help you win out, but if other offers are very similar and yours has a personal touch, it will definitely help. So, consider writing the seller a letter about you and your family, and about what their home would mean to you.

As always, you have the dream; we have the address.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
