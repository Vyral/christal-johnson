Most people are not aware that the market has shifted. Homes aren’t flying off the shelf like they were two years ago. Back then, it didn’t matter much if you picked the best agent because the market protected you. But, now, you need to have an agent that knows the right strategy to help you sell your home. Let me prove it.

**Real data, real results**. My wife and I recently sold our home in Manassas. We used the exact strategies I share with my clients. I don’t just talk about these things—I live them. And guess what? The results speak for themselves.

* We sold our property for $304 per square foot.
* It sold in 8 days (the average in the area is 14 days).
* We sold for $22,500 over list price—nearly 3% over asking.

To help you see the bigger picture, let’s compare it with the other homes in the same neighborhood that sold for much less:

* $266 per square foot
* $278 per square foot
* $267 per square foot

In fact, one property even listed at $219 per square foot—and it has a pool. So, what made the biggest difference between our properties that we sold from the other ones listed? It all boils down to our strategy. Here’s what we did to sell fast and at top dollar:

* **Pricing right:** We listed lower to attract multiple offers. This created competition. Competition drives up the price.
* **Preparation:** Our home was market-ready. We didn’t cut corners.
* **Protecting the sale price:** There’s a difference between getting an offer and getting a solid contract. We used contingencies to protect the price.

You might think any agent will use the same strategy, or maybe you know someone who sells homes “on the side.” knows how to do all these things. But, the truth is not everyone can spot small details like this. Remember, selling in today’s market is all about the details. So, if your agent doesn’t have a strategy, you’ll leave money on the table.
