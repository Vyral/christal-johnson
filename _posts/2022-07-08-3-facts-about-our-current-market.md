Real estate has undergone several changes lately, making many buyers and sellers nervous about their plans. Today let’s discuss what you need to know about the current market so you can be ready to act.

First, understand that **real estate is hyperlocal**. The national media has been talking quite a bit about the market, but those national trends may not reflect what’s going on in our area. A market just 10 miles away might have a different experience than ours.

Second, know that **not every market is hot anymore**. Some areas are still pretty active, while others have slowed down quite a bit. Confer with your real estate professional about your own market so that you can act according to your area’s conditions.

Finally, **who you work with matters more than ever**. Be sure to work with an agent who understands your market’s trends and can educate you so that you make good decisions. The decisions you make now can impact you even 10 years down the road.

If you have any questions about what’s going on in our market or how it affects your real estate plans, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.
