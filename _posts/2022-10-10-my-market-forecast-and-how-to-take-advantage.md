Where do you think this constantly changing market is heading next? That can be a very tricky question to answer. I’m here today to tell you my forecast for the next six months and talk about six real estate opportunities you can take advantage of in the near future: Well here are the six places I predict we will be seeing great opportunities:&nbsp;

**1\. Listings with realistic sellers.** We are still in a market where good real estate that’s priced well will sell, so sellers with realistic expectations will succeed.&nbsp;

**2\. Listings for buyers that need a little help.** If you are a buyer that needs help with the closing costs or buying down your rate you will have opportunities for deals with those things.&nbsp;

**3\. Value-add properties.** This would be a house that needs some work to get where you want it. Buyers are starting to look more at homes like that.

**4\. Properties for move-up investors.** There have been a lot of people lately who have wanted my help upgrading to a bigger house. I believe this will continue.&nbsp;

**5\. Commercial properties to purchase.** Many people are wanting to move from leasing commercial properties to buying them. This is a great opportunity for business owners. Also, we have a commercial division that can help with matters like this.&nbsp;

**6\. Properties from move-down sellers.** People who are retiring or relocating are doing so now while the market is still this way, so take advantage of the homes they are giving up.&nbsp;

If you think you fit into any of the boxes of those six opportunities or are interested in any of them, reach out to us so you can take advantage of this\! Call or email my team and I anytime, we look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
