Today we’re sitting down to be interviewed about how we make it work: being married and also working together.

Today we’re discussing love and real estate. Christal and Allen Johnson have been married for 11 years. Christal has learned over the years that Allen will keep pushing her out of her comfort zone and “I’ll take that as a great sign that our relationship continues to grow.” Allen has come to realize that love evolves, that there are a lot of different phases of love, and “I feel every year our love gets more dynamic.” Today Christal and Allen are being interviewed about what it’s like to work together in real estate as a married couple. There are specific challenges and advantages to this type of business.
