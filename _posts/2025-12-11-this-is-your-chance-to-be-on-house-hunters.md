Plenty of people watch House Hunters and imagine what it would feel like to be the one walking through homes on national TV. Now that same chance is opening up again. HGTV reached out to our team and asked us to help them find buyers who are ready to begin their home search and want to share the experience on camera. This isn’t a generic casting call. They came straight to us, which means you’re hearing about a real opportunity that doesn’t come around often.

**A unique opening for local homebuyers.** The casting team is selecting buyers over the next 60 to 90 days and wants people who are preparing to purchase a home with our team or plan to work with us soon. They’re looking for a wide range of buyers, including first-timers, upsizers, downsizers, relocating families, retirees, and singles beginning a new chapter. People with real stories are precisely what the show highlights, and that’s who they hope to meet through us.

HGTV continues to return to our clients because they enjoy how our buyers look on camera and the trust they place in the experience we provide. You’re stepping into something with agents who have already been through the process, understand how it works, and can support you through each step.

**Inside the filming experience.** Since Krystal and I have both filmed episodes, we can give you a clear picture of what the day is like. The production team brings a fun, upbeat energy. There’s plenty of laughing and lighthearted moments, though the experience also brings a bit of structure. You might repeat a line or walk through a doorway more than once to capture the right angle. Even with the extra takes, the whole process feels enjoyable and rewarding when you finally see the finished show.

Krystal had a great time filming with our friend and client, Cherise. Spending the day together made the experience memorable, and she loved learning how much work goes into building a 20-minute episode. For me, the journey was different. The first episode I filmed didn’t make the final cut, which can happen since they shoot much more than they use.

The second time, I was the featured agent while helping one of our own team members buy a home, and that gave me new insight into how emotional buying can be, even for someone who works in real estate every day. Homebuyers often feel a mix of excitement and nerves, and filming adds a new twist to the story, but the memories you walk away with make it worthwhile.

**What does the casting team look for?** The show doesn’t require acting skills or prominent personalities. The casting team wants clear communicators with warm, natural energy who are comfortable sharing their real buying journey. As long as you enjoy talking about what matters most to you in a home and don’t mind a camera nearby, you’re already a strong candidate. HGTV also provides a small per diem for your time, which is a nice bonus.

Anyone who wants to explore this opportunity can call or text us at [**(571) 210-1818**](tel:5712101818){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or send us an email [**connect@ajteamrealty.com**](mailto:connect@ajteamrealty.com) using the **subject line House Hunters**. We’ll walk you through what comes next and help you decide whether filming is the right fit. Your home search is already a meaningful moment, and this could make it even more memorable. When you’re ready to start the journey, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.
