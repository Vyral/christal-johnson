When people are preparing to move, they often tell me they want to do so when their lease is over and when their children are out of school for the year.&nbsp;

A buyer’s timeline is of critical importance. That’s why when my team and I talk to buyers, there are three things we like to highlight during that conversation.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Your timeline is always longer than you think.**&nbsp;If you’re looking to buy a resale home, the average timeline for that purchase is three to four months. For new construction properties, your timeline may be more like 10, 12, or even 18 months. So, you may want to start looking sooner than you think
2. **Your perfect home won’t appear during your timeline.**&nbsp;Instead, it will more likely show up in accordance with the seller’s timeline. If a seller is downsizing or moving to a warmer climate, they will most likely put their property on the market during the spring. Don’t just depend on your timeline, make sure you understand the psyche of the seller.
3. **You must be flexible.**&nbsp;If you’re worried about timing your transaction perfectly so that your lease is up just as you’re buying, there’s something you need to realize about house payments. Did you know that you don’t make your first month’s payment for 45 days after you settle in? These are things you need to keep in mind. Don’t be too strict with your timeline.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
