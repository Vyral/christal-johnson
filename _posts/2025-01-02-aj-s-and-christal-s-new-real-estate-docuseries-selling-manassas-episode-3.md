Today, we’re diving into the primary bathroom, a spot where hidden issues can cost you big. Don’t let small problems become expensive disasters.

**Check everything.** During a home inspection, we follow the same steps every time. We start with the electrical outlets and vent fan. Loose outlets or non-functional fans might seem minor, but they’re important for safety and comfort. Next, we test the hot and cold water at every faucet and shower. You’d be surprised how often one doesn’t work, and fixing it later can be a hassle.

**Leaks can hide anywhere.** Leaks are sneaky, which is why you need to be meticulous when looking for them. We use a flashlight to scan for signs of water damage under sinks, around fixtures, and in hidden spots. Even if there’s no active leak now, past damage tells a story. We also check the tiles and grout to make sure everything is sealed. Cracks or missing grout invite water damage, and that’s a costly repair waiting to happen.

**Shower doors are a hidden hazard.** Here’s something you might not think about—shower doors. If the hinges are loose or misaligned, the tempered glass can break. I’ve seen it happen, and it’s dangerous. It’s an easy fix, but only if you catch it early.

**Even the small things matter.** We test every door to ensure it latches and fits properly. If a door doesn’t close right, it can damage the frame over time. We also flush every toilet twice. Why twice? Some leaks only show up after the first flush.

Your bathroom might seem fine, but hidden issues can add up. A thorough inspection finds these problems before they become costly headaches. If you’re buying or selling a home, don’t skip this step to ensure your home is safe, functional, and ready for you to enjoy. **If you’re planning a home inspection and you need help with it, you can call or text me at (571) 210-1818 and I’ll help you ensure you are checking everything you need in your property.**
