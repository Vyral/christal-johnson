If you’ve ever wondered why some students fall behind in school, it’s not always about grades or effort. Sometimes, it’s about something much simpler—Not having food, clean clothes, or a place to sleep.

**In Prince William County, more than 40 students at one local high school are facing housing insecurity.** That means they’re showing up to class tired, hungry, and unsure where they’ll sleep that night. When basic needs aren’t met, learning becomes almost impossible.

Many students are dealing with more than we realize. Some wear the same clothes every day. Others go to school without enough food. Many don’t have reliable transportation. These challenges affect more than grades. They impact confidence, focus, and mental health. Students in these situations often feel invisible or ashamed. Over time, that takes a toll.

**With our Be a Blessing Foundation**, we want to change that and help these children have a bright future. **We are a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit,** and our mission is to provide emergency assistance to families in need throughout Prince William County. We work closely with local social workers and schools by providing support, such as food, clothing, transportation, and basic household needs.

This year, we’ve adopted a local high school with a high number of students facing housing insecurity. Our goal is to meet the most urgent needs to help these students feel safe, seen, and supported. We want to allow them to focus on their education without the daily stress of survival.

To raise funds for this effort, we’re hosting our biggest event of the year that we call the **“Be a Blessing 5K”** and it will take place on **April 26, 2025, at Upcoming Regional Park**. Everyone is welcome to join so we can give more support to the students that are in need. You can run, walk, or cheer from the sidelines and we will make sure that your participation helps us serve more families.

All proceeds go directly to supporting students and their families as we will use it to provide food, clothing, transportation, and other basic essentials. Every time someone works with our real estate group, a portion of that business supports Be a Blessing Foundation. For over 20 years, we’ve been doing this to give back to the place we call home because we believe in building a strong connection between business and community.

No child should have to choose between learning and survival, and that’s why we encourage you to join us at our biggest event this year. If you have any questions, feel free to call or text us at **(571) 210-1818** or email [info@ajteamrealty.com.](mailto:info@ajteamrealty.com) We look forward to hearing from you!
