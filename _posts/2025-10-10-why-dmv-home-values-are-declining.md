Many homeowners believe the DMV housing market can weather any cycle, but even the strongest markets experience turning points, and that time has arrived. Today, we’ll reveal what’s really happening beneath the surface.

After navigating both boom and bust cycles for 25 years, we’re seeing clear signs of correction, with values dipping anywhere from 1% to 2% in some neighborhoods to as much as 15% in parts of D.C.

Let me break down the main factors driving this shift and explain what it means for homeowners, sellers, and buyers across the region. More importantly, I’ll outline eight opportunities that can help you adapt, protect your equity, and even grow through this market transition.
