It’s a tough market right now for buyers. If you’re looking to purchase a home, does that mean you should just wait until spring? I don’t think so, and that’s why today I want to give you five reasons why you should buy sooner rather than later:

**1\. New-builds are delayed.** I’ve seen plenty of move-in dates on new-build properties get moved back recently, and there are two big reasons why. First, supply chain issues mean they can’t receive the materials they need. Second, we’re in a labor shortage, and contractors are hard to come by.&nbsp;

**2\. You need a head start in this market.** This is one of the most complex real estate markets we’ve seen in a while. The more time you have to prepare, the more successful you’ll be.&nbsp;

**3\. It gives you time to recalibrate.** Many people head into the market thinking they want one thing, only to realize they want something else. If you start early, you have time to make changes before the frenzy starts.&nbsp;

**4\. You can avoid the spring chaos.** Our current real estate market is pretty crazy already. Once spring starts, it’s only going to get wilder.&nbsp;

**5\. Your perfect home never aligns with your perfect timeline.** You never know when your dream house will hit the market, so you need to be prepared for when it does. When I bought my current home, my family wasn’t 100% ready to move, but I had my eye on the market anyway. I’m glad I did because as soon as I saw the property, I put in a strong offer and won.&nbsp;
