A lot of places talk about opportunity without going into specifics, but that’s not how we do things here. That’s why we want to give you six opportunities with specifics in today’s market:

**1\. Move-up buyers.** If you are looking to upgrade, this is a fantastic market. The market has pulled back a little bit, but this effect is mostly felt on higher-end homes. That means you can easily sell your entry-level home for top dollar, then get a great deal on a nicer home.&nbsp;

**2\. Fatigued buyers.** If you tried to buy a home six months ago and were frustrated with how competitive things were, now may be the time to hop back in. Interest rates remain low, but competition has begun to slow down.&nbsp;

**3\. Movers.** If you are looking to move to a cheaper or different area like Raleigh, Tampa, or Texas, you could sell your home for a ton of money relative to where you’re moving to. You can then use that money to find a fantastic home.&nbsp;

**4\. Vacation homes.** The prices for vacation homes have increased, but there are still great deals to be found, especially if you don’t look in the most common markets. The pandemic and the Thanksgiving season have helped a lot of us realize what we really value, and if you want a fun place to take your family every year, now could be the time to buy.&nbsp;

**5\. Long-term rental properties.** There is no better time to own and purchase a long-term rental property. Home prices are stabilizing, but rents continue to increase. Our interest rates also remain low, so now is a great time to buy.&nbsp;

**6\. Commercial properties.** This might be the best opportunity in the market right now. The commercial market is on fire, and interest rates are low; if you want to build generational wealth, now could be the time to invest.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about these opportunities or anything else, please call or email us. We would love to help you in any way we can.
