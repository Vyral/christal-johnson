Why would your agent lie to you? There are a couple of reasons.

The first reason is that, sometimes, people just can’t handle the truth. And by the time they finally can handle the truth, sometimes it’s too late. For example, I once had a client who couldn’t handle it when I told them the truth about what price their home should be listed at. They got it, but they didn’t really get it, and by the time they finally did get it, it was too late. Their home spent three months on the market, and during that time, the market shifted.

When an agent tells you the truth instead of what you want to hear, it’s important that you act on what they tell you in a timely manner, because the market could look very different in just three or four months.

The second reason agents lie to their clients is your reactions can be misleading. Think about it—when you deliver bad news to someone, are you ever excited about it? We agents never want to deliver bad news to our clients, but sometimes the way our clients react to that bad news is a double whammy—we have to deal with the bad news of the transaction itself and how badly you might react to that news.

We don’t love delivering bad news, but we’re all working toward the same goal, so we have to deliver bad news so we can adjust, move on, and get the best deal possible. This is why it’s so important that you and your agent communicate through this type of situation.

How do you handle bad news? It’s like I tell my clients sometimes—if you’re at work trying to handle a high-stress situation, that’s probably not the best time to receive bad news. It might be better to wait until you have a moment to decompress so you and your agent can discuss the situation without emotion or without any exterior stress life might be trying to bring you.

Buying or selling a home isn’t easy, so again, you need to communicate with your agent to the point where they’re comfortable delivering bad news to you. On our team, we never, ever lie to our clients. We give you the news straight—no chaser. However, we also try to deliver that news gracefully, so we expect that same grace in return so we can help you reach your end goal.

Remember—you have the dream, we have the address. If you have any questions about this topic or you have any real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.
