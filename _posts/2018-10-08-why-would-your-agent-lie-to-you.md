Why would your agent lie to you? There are a couple of reasons.

The first reason is that, sometimes, people just can’t handle the truth. And by the time they finallycan handle the truth, sometimes it’s too late. For example, I once had a client who couldn’t handle itwhen I told them the truth about what price their home should be listed at. They got it, but they didn’treally get it, and by the time they finally did get it, it was too late. Their home spent three months onthe market, and during that time, the market shifted.

When an agent tells you the truth instead of what you want to hear, it’s important that you act on whatthey tell you in a timely manner, because the market could look very different in just three or fourmonths.

The second reason agents lie to their clients is your reactions can be misleading. Think about it—when you deliver bad news to someone, are you ever excited about it? We agents never want todeliver bad news to our clients, but sometimes the way our clients react to that bad news is a doublewhammy—we have to deal with the bad news of the transaction itself and how badly you might reactto that news.

We don’t love delivering bad news, but we’re all working toward the same goal, so we have to deliverbad news so we can adjust, move on, and get the best deal possible. This is why it’s so important thatyou and your agent communicate through this type of situation.

How do you handle bad news? It’s like I tell my clients sometimes—if you’re at work trying to handle ahigh-stress situation, that’s probably not the best time to receive bad news. It might be better to waituntil you have a moment to decompress so you and your agent can discuss the situation withoutemotion or without any exterior stress life might be trying to bring you.

Buying or selling a home isn’t easy, so again, you need to communicate with your agent to thepoint where they’re comfortable delivering bad news to you. On our team, we never, ever lie toour clients. We give you the news straight—no chaser. However, we also try to deliver that newsgracefully, so we expect that same grace in return so we can help you reach your end goal.

Remember—you have the dream, we have the address. If you have any questions about this topic oryou have any real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love tohelp you.
