The latest market reports have arrived, shedding light on the real estate landscape as we transition from 2023 into 2024. With inventory levels significantly impacting the market, we're observing trends that are essential for both sellers and buyers in the DMV area to understand. Let's delve into the key findings and what they mean for your real estate decisions.

**A primary driver behind the current market dynamics is the lack of inventory, which has led to an almost 8% decrease in closed sales compared to 2022.** December 2023 saw inventory levels drop nearly 15% from the previous year, marking the lowest level of new monthly listings in over two decades. This scarcity is contributing to homes selling quickly, with the average property going under contract in just 19 days.

Specific areas within the DMV have experienced notable growth, with Prince William and Frederick Counties leading the charge with almost 14% and 15% median price increases, respectively. Fairfax and Loudoun Counties also saw significant growth. However, the speed at which homes sell varies by county, highlighting the unique characteristics of each local market.

For those considering selling, the current low supply presents a favorable opportunity. Starting the process 30 to 60 days earlier than planned could be advantageous, given the competitive landscape. Buyers, on the other hand, facing challenges in finding their ideal home should seek specialized guidance. **Our connections with agents and new construction communities offer access to inventory that might not be widely known.**

The DMV real estate market remains robust, with unique opportunities and challenges across different regions.
