I get calls all the time from clients who say, “I’m ready to list my home on the market. What should I do to prepare it?” I’d like to answer this question with a quick story. About ten years ago, I was working with a client who had already spent $20,000 remodeling the kitchen in her home in order to get it ready to be sold. Though the kitchen looked nice, she wasn’t prepared to spend much more on the renovations that I would have suggested she make.&nbsp;

At the closing table, this client asked the buyer about the first thing that he was planning to do when he moved into her home. The buyer responded, “The first thing I’m going to do is rip out and remodel that kitchen\!” The lesson here is to realize that your tastes won’t necessarily match the tastes of a potential buyer.&nbsp;

This is why rule number one when it comes to preparing your house for the market is to make smart renovations. You will not always see a return on every single dollar you put into your property upon selling it. If you put $50,000 into a renovation, that does not necessarily equal $50,000 in added value. Make sure you understand your budget.&nbsp;

My second tip to prepare your home for the market is simply to paint. This is a very quick, easy, and cost-effective way to add value to your home. When painting, though, be sure to paint in neutral colors. Here’s an advanced painting tip: If you’re wondering what kinds of colors are the best ones to use to paint, go to your builder or a model home like yours and use the colors that they’re using. These companies spend thousands of dollars on designers that know much more about paint colors than you or I do, and those are the color palettes that most buyers want to see. It’s also crucial to paint your front door. The front door is one of the first things that potential buyers will notice in the moments before they enter the home.&nbsp;

Replacing your front door is a very smart move for the same reason. Make sure that your front entrance provides the ambiance necessary to open up the rest of the home in the eyes of the buyer. Finally, if you’re wondering whether you should make necessary repairs before you list your home, the answer is always yes. There is, however, a major difference between making a necessary repair and getting a cosmetic upgrade.&nbsp;

Anything that needs to be fixed, like a malfunctioning sink, a leaky roof, or a foundational issue, should be repaired immediately. Buyers will find out about those issues during the home inspection anyway, so make sure that those repairs are made ahead of time. If you have any other questions about getting your home ready for the market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. Remember, you have the dream; we have the address. &nbsp;
