As today’s story will demonstrate, it’s important to have a strategy when selling your home.


Today I have a quick seller story to share with you to emphasize the importance of having a strategy in place when selling.

This seller wanted to sell their Alexandria condo. It had been a good rental property for them for about 10 years, but they decided it was time to liquidate. When the seller originally came to me, they planned on selling the condo to their tenant. Although it took four weeks, I eventually convinced them that this would be a bad idea.

After the tenant moved out, there was a decision to be made: Would we upgrade or keep the property in the same condition? After I had my contractors go through the property, we decided to make about $10,000 worth of updates over six weeks, including new paint, hardwood floors, granite countertops, and appliances.

The client would’ve originally sold the home as is to their tenant for $195,000, but with these upgrades, we sold for $218,000—a difference of $23,000. As a homeowner, if I were to tell you that a $10,000 investment would return $23,000, I bet you’d take that deal every day of the week.

This is the type of process we take all our sellers through. If you’re looking to net as much money as you can from your home sale, we can put together a strategy to get the highest return on your investment.
