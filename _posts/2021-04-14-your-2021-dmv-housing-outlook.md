Welcome to your 2021 DMV housing outlook\! Every year during this time, I like to look back on the previous year and share my thoughts and predictions about what lies ahead. We’re still in a seller’s market, but that may very well start to change soon. Interest rates and inventory will make or break your plans if you’re a buyer or seller.&nbsp;

**Feel free to watch the video above in its entirety to get all my predictions or use these timestamps to skip ahead to various sections at your leisure:&nbsp;**

0:26—Watch interest rates closely

1:02—Why I think inventory levels will convince sellers to cash out

1:51—If you’re thinking of investing, look to the ‘tertiary’ counties (i.e., those outside the Beltway)

3:07—How increasing home renovation costs affect you

4:08—We’re still in a seller’s market, but that could change for one of two reasons&nbsp;

5:04—The last word from CNBC

6:10—Wrapping things up

As always, if you have questions about our DMV market or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
