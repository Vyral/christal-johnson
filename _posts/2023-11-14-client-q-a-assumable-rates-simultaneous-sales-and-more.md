Today, we’re doing something a little different. We recently sat down with a client to ask her a few questions about her experience with us and what it was like. We’ll talk to her about her home sale, assuming a mortgage to save money, and much more. This client had a pretty unique experience, so you won’t want to miss our conversation.&nbsp;
