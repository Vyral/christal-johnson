There are several vital steps you need to take if you’re looking to sell your home priced under $400,000.

What’s the difference between selling a home under $400,000 and selling a home that’s over $400,000?
In our market, the $400,000 price-range is the price point for a first time homebuyer. When you’re selling
a home to a first time homebuyer, there are certain steps you need to take to ensure a successful sale.
Understanding the psychology of a first-time buyer is crucial for getting top dollar for your home. Most
first time homebuyers are nervous about their upcoming purchase, so here are a few tips to help make
the buyer comfortable and ensure a smooth transaction.

**1. Make sure that your home is easily accessible.** We understand that you may be busy, but most first
time homebuyers cannot visit the property at the drop of a hat, so being available when the buyer is
ready is key.

**2. Price your home right. Today’s buyers have access to all types of information.** If your home isn’t priced
right, or even perceived as priced right, it’s not going to sell. If you are priced a little high, be sure to adjust
fast. If you do not receive offers within two weeks, you need to consider lowering the list price.

**3. Make simple repairs.** First-time homebuyers are what I like to call “HGTV buyers”, meaning they don’t
know how to make simple repairs or don’t understand the costs involved. A quick internet search for
these services can result in worst case scenarios, which will scare buyers away. Don’t leave anything
to the imagination.

**4. Remodel for your buyer’s taste, not your own.** Do some research to find out what other sellers have
done to their homes, and mimic that. Don’t remodel your home based on what you like, as future buyers
may not have the same taste.

Going through these steps will help ensure a smooth sale to an often nervous first-time homebuyer.
