Many homeowners want to transition to a more manageable space but can’t find options that fit their needs. Stairs, outdated communities, and limited availability make it difficult to move forward.

The good news? A new 55+ active living community has just been released in Belmont Bay on the east side of Prince William County. This isn’t a retirement home—it’s luxury living designed for comfort, convenience, and flexibility. Here’s why this could be the perfect fit for you:

**1\. The location is unbeatable.** Belmont Bay is in North Woodbridge, offering better traffic flow for commuters heading into the city. Even better, it’s a waterfront community, providing a peaceful, upscale feel. If you enjoy walking by the water or simply love the view, this location is ideal.

**2\. Low-maintenance living makes life easier.** With a monthly HOA fee of just $140, you don’t have to worry about landscaping or exterior upkeep. Whether you want to lock up and travel south for the winter or visit family for weeks at a time, your home stays well-maintained while you’re away.

**3\. Modern homes with full accessibility.** Unlike older communities, these townhomes are built with convenience in mind. Each home has an elevator that connects all three levels, making stairs a thing of the past. The layouts are spacious and flexible:

* First floor: Walk in from your two-car garage and access the elevator. There’s even an option to add a bedroom or patio.
* Second floor: Enjoy a bright, open floor plan with a great room, dining area, deck, and large pantry.
* Third floor: The elevator brings you to your bedrooms with ease.

These modern finishes and open designs make entertaining or day-to-day living a breeze.

**4\. Limited availability means it won’t last.** This community only has 18 townhomes available, making it one of the few 55+ active living options on the east side of Prince William County. With demand for homes like these growing, these townhomes are expected to sell quickly.

If you or someone you know is ready to downsize—or “right-size” into a home that better fits your needs—this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. **You can call or text me today at (571) 210-1818 to discuss the details of this new place**
