If you don’t already know, we own a nonprofit, where some of our returning clients, whom I’ve met at Mason, have graciously contributed by helping in our mentoring program. Being able to use our network to do great and fun things like this means a lot to us\!

Due to our great work for the community, **I was recognized by George Mason University’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences (CHSS) as one of their distinguished alumni.** The award brings me a lot of joy, but knowing that the work we do for the community and university is acknowledged gives us the affirmation to continue to do it.&nbsp;

The award takes me back to one of my fondest memories: The time I met my wife at the campus. In between Roberts and Johnson Center, I met the love of my life, Christal Johnson.&nbsp;

Again, thank you for the award\!
