Today I want to take a break and share a personal story with my daughter, Camille Johnson.&nbsp;

As some of you may know, I recently wrote a book titled “50 Things Your Real Estate Agent Should Tell You But Probably Won’t”. Two weeks ago, my daughter came to me and asked me for two of my books. I was a little confused why she wanted them, but eventually she told me that she wanted to give a copy of the book to her teacher and her school library.&nbsp;

She included a nice note with the books, and soon, her teacher wrote us a lovely thank-you note back. Camille’s teacher said she was so proud of the author in her family, and that she appreciated all the hard work that went into it. **I won’t lie; I’ve cried multiple times reading this note.** To hear my daughter be proud of me was absolutely priceless, and it made me realize why I had written the book in the first place.&nbsp;

Maybe you’re working hard at something to make a special person in your life proud right now. **My advice is to keep at it, even if it’s hard work.** At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how many copies of this book I sell. The fact that I made my daughter proud is worth more than anything to me.&nbsp;

As always, if you are looking to buy or sell a home, please call or email me. If you have the dream, we have the address.
