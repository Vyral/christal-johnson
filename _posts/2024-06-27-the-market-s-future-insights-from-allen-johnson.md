In this insightful discussion, I sat down with real estate expert Allen Johnson to review his market predictions from December and how they've played out. Allen accurately foresaw stable interest rates, troubles in the commercial real estate sector, and challenges in secondary and vacation markets. He also highlighted how real estate agents are feeling the market's impact more than homeowners and predicted a stabilization of home prices.

Looking ahead, Allen shares his forecasts for the next quarter, emphasizing the importance of quality real estate and evolving trends in multigenerational living and luxury markets.
