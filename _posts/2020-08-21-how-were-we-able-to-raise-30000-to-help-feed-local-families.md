As you may know, I’m a parent mentor at Featherstone Elementary School. As a mentor, I felt it was my responsibility to do what I could to help the school community when COVID-19 first hit. When I reached out to Featherstone Elementary, they told me they needed groceries for families in need. That’s when my team and I sprang into action.

All told, we were able to raise $30,000 to provide food for local families. To learn more about our efforts to help the community,&nbsp;**you can read&nbsp;*[this article](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2944951716670009718/8730561727063847043#)*&nbsp;that was recently published on the Prince William County Public Schools website.**

Helping those in need is more important now than ever, so if you have a cause you’re passionate about that my team and I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.
