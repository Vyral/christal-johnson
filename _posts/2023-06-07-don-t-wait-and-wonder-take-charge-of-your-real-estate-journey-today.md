Are you feeling lost in the midst of conflicting information about the housing market? Rest assured, you're not alone. Today, I want to share a secret that no one in the real estate industry wants you to know. The current state of the housing market is unlike anything we've ever experienced before. We're all navigating uncharted territory.

One of the most perplexing aspects is **the paradox between low transaction levels and high interest rates.** Normally, these factors would indicate a recession. However, despite what you might see in the news, we're not in a recession. The housing market is exhibiting some unusual patterns that can leave anyone scratching their head.

For instance, in the DMV area, transaction volume has plummeted by 40%, yet prices have remained stable. Showings have increased significantly, but the number of offers hasn't followed suit. Some houses are selling like hotcakes, while others linger on the market for extended periods. It's a landscape marked by instability and uncertainty, which has caused many potential buyers and sellers to adopt a wait-and-see approach.
