What should sellers be aware of in this housing market? You should understand that things have changed. We don’t know what that change is exactly, but **the market is different.** I’ve talked to some agents who had no showings last week, which is weird. That doesn’t mean things are crashing, and it doesn’t mean the same will happen to your house. However, something has changed in real estate, and we have to make sure we understand it.

I talked with a seller recently who was thinking about selling. He asked if he could sell and feel like he’s getting the most out of his property five years from now. I told him that in only two to three years, he won’t be able to do what he could do today as a seller.&nbsp;

You need to make sure you’re thinking long term in this market. You should either sell now or plan to keep your home for a while. **Sellers also need to use the right strategy from the beginning and stick with it**; you can’t hem and haw over it last minute. Price the property right, and do what’s best for you and your family.

We'll keep an eye on this changing market and see what happens. If you have any questions about our changing market or real estate in general, feel free to call or email me. I would love to hear from you.
