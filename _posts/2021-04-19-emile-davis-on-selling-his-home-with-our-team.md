We recently helped Emile Davis and his wife sell their home, and today he joins me to recount his experience during the process. Emile was previously part of a home sale that was coordinated by a solo agent, so he’s uniquely qualified to describe the benefits of selling your home with The AJ Team behind you. He compares our ability to work together to that of a Cirque du Soleil troupe, and he was so impressed with our service that he convinced members of his family to trust us with their home selling needs.&nbsp;
