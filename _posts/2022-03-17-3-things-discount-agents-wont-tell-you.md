A discount agent is an agent that’s advertising a discount to attract your business. They’ll tell you everything you want to hear, but the truth lies in what they won’t tell you. Here are three things that you will not hear from a discount agent:

**1\. Which renovations will give you maximum value.** Why? They only understand one value: the value of the discount. They’ve built their businesses off that understanding, so they can’t tell you which renovations are good or bad investments. Teams like ours, on the other hand, know the most you can get out of your home and want to help you achieve it. This includes letting you know what projects are worth putting money into and which ones aren’t.&nbsp;

**2\. The best way to negotiate.** They only know one way of negotiation: discounts. When it comes to negotiating the sale of your home, they don’t have any other strategies than that. If you want to sell for a discount, then a discount agent is for you. If you don’t, you need to find someone more in tune with real estate principles.

**3\. How to build real estate wealth.** They only care about the discount, and they aren’t wired to teach you how to build lasting wealth through real estate. Relationships are everything in this business, and it’s nearly impossible to build a good relationship with a discount agent. We teach our clients how to build wealth.

In some markets, discount agents have value. If 20 people are clamoring for your home and there’s nothing else on the market, it's a much easier decision to choose one. When we aren’t in a hyper seller's market like we’re in now, you need a local expert on your side. If you had an important contract or had to go to court, you wouldn’t hire LegalZoom for that. You would hire a high-level lawyer to protect you. Similarly, you need a high-level agent in this complex real estate market.

**If you are considering a discount broker, here are a couple of questions that I would always ask them:**

* How many investment properties do you own?
* What do you invest in yourself?
* Why did you choose your discount agency?

Asking these questions will give you a great idea if the discount agent you’re considering is the right fit. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
