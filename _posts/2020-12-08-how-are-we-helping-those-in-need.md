This has been a tough season for many local families.

We have decided to partner with a good friend and social worker at a local high school, to identify 12 families that we can collectively bless. We personally met each family a few days before Thanksgiving when we delivered $5k in gift cards, cash, and prayers.

We thought that was the end, but as we got to know these families better and heard their stories, **we knew it wouldn’t be right not to continue.**&nbsp;

* Mom of 3 can’t work due to chemo.
* Mom taking care of a disabled husband who can’t work. Behind on rent and utilities. \*We got them caught up, but every month is a month they are falling behind.
* 10th grader living w/ extended family and is responsible for his utilities, food, etc.
* 22-year-old taking care of his 3 younger sisters. Mom passed away last year.&nbsp;

These are just a few of the stories. They are heartbreaking and hit far too close to home.

Many times I find that when we are looking to change the world, God is simply asking us to take care of our neighbors.

**Our plan is to bless these families with the help of our family (YOU)\!**

The AJ Team will be donating $10k to these families for rent, utilities, and emergency funds. It would be a blessing for you to consider adopting a family or donate a gift card. Below are links to e-gift cards. You can send them directly to Erin\!

**Our goal is to have these gift cards distributed to these families by December 15, 2020.** If you prefer to donate directly through our non-profit organization, Be a Blessing Foundation, Inc. to take advantage of tax-deductible charitable contributions, that link is below as well. \*\*Receipts will be provided for any donation over $250.
