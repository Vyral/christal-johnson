A while ago, I spoke with one of our clients, Emile Davis, to get an understanding of what the home selling process was like from his side of the table. The *[first episode of our interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLKAduNVKv4&amp;ab_channel=AJTeam)* aired in mid-April, and we’re back today for the second and final part.&nbsp;

**I’ve known Emile for a long time, but I understand there needs to be a balance when working with friends in a professional setting.** After all, you don’t necessarily want your buddy making life-changing financial decisions for you. So, I asked Emile how he felt while working with me—his friend and his agent.

Emile believes that, although we were good friends, we were able to press pause when it came to doing business. When doing paperwork, consultations, walkthroughs, and other sales-related tasks, Emile says I gave my advice and worked as a professional first and foremost. According to him, it was a situation that worked out incredibly well.

Emile and I actually started talking about selling his home about two years ago, and it’s a route I think everyone should follow with their agent. Start talking to your Realtor well before you’re ready to move. It lets them know that you’re in an area of your life where you’ll need to move soon, but it also lets you know what kind of agent they actually are.&nbsp;

You get to see how they answer your questions, understand how they work within the market, and witness their success as a professional. By the time you’re ready to sell, you’ve already built up a good relationship with your Realtor. For example, by knowing Emile, I understood that our team wasn’t just working for his needs—we needed to advocate for his family as well.

**Emile also praised our vendors for their high level of professionalism.** They came through right on time, gave great advice, and provided fantastic service. He said that, essentially, the AJ Team’s standards of care trickled down to everyone else he interacted with during the selling process.

I’d like to thank Emile for sharing his candid thoughts about how it felt working with us. If you’d like to learn more about what we can do for you, or if you have any questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
