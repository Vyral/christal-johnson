I’m joined once again by my father, Lenwood, to discuss some of the information from my book. This time, we focused on how to find your lane in real estate.

**Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:**

0:55- How did my father find his lane in real estate?

3:55- Why you need a strong agent to act as your “GPS”

5:00- Why sharing our expertise can be a double-edged sword

6:30- A story that demonstrates why you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover or an agent by their language

8:23- Why you shouldn't’ be afraid of making mistakes in real estate

9:15- Wrapping things up

If you have any questions for me about anything we discussed or anything related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.
