There’s a listing by a real estate agent in Oklahoma that’s currently getting tons of buzz. See a photo and the details of the house at 0:25 in the video above. It’s listed at $190,000 in Oklahoma City, and the listing is pretty funny. That’s because the description reads: “Tired of touring houses and it being straight dog water? Say less my NON GENDER SPECIFIC HUMAN\! This house be bussin bussin, NO CAP\! Come in the door however you can, and be prepared to yell ‘SHEEEEEESH’”.&nbsp;

Here’s the crazy thing: The home went under contract in one day, and the listing has close to 40,000 views on Zillow\! That listing got me thinking about a few things we agents need to keep in mind:

**1\. Be confident.** You need to be confident in yourself and your product. (Especially if you’re writing a description like that.)

**2\. Know your audience.** This agent was selling a house under $200,000, and likely the person who’s buying that property will relate to that type of language. The agent knew his audience and wasn’t afraid to speak to the people who would be most interested in that property.&nbsp;

**3\. Buyers are changing.** As agents, we need to understand that buyers are changing. I’m having conversations with clients who are buying $1,000,000+ properties, but we’ll also discuss Nas’s or Kanye’s latest album. That wasn’t likely to happen a few years ago.

**4\. Take some chances.** For any business, COVID-19 has taught us that this is the market in which you want to be taking chances, and can.&nbsp;

What the agent said was probably true. In that price range, the houses in this market were likely straight dog water, and he just said it\! Whoever that agent is in Oklahoma City, to me, you get the real estate listing award of the year.

If you want to buy or sell a house that’s not straight dog water, give us a call. We would love to help you get a result that makes you say “SHEEEEEESH\!”
