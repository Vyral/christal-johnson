Many people assume that now is not a good time to be in the real estate market due to the high interest rates. However, what we’re seeing now is probably one of the biggest opportunities in the last five years, and it’s called “assumable mortgages.” The way it works is you can take over a seller’s existing mortgage, including their existing loans, and it can actually save you a lot in interest rates. We’ve seen buyers lock in interest rates as low as 2.75%, 1.25%, or even 4.5%. If you can find sellers with these interest rates, you can save more in interest than the actual price of the home.

Today, I’ll explain how assumable mortgages work, why they’re so valuable in today’s market, and what both buyers and sellers need to do to take advantage. From lower monthly payments to shorter loan terms, these rare opportunities offer real financial benefits if you’re prepared.
