There’s been a lot of talk about the proposed 50-year mortgage, and we understand why it sounds appealing. The idea of lowering monthly payments can be tempting, but upon examining the numbers, the long-term costs are concerning.

A longer loan might save a few hundred dollars each month, but it can also double the total interest paid. On a $500,000 home, that could mean paying around $1.1 million in interest instead of about $600,000 on a 30-year loan.

**In the short term, this kind of loan might help more people qualify to buy, but it doesn’t truly make homes more affordable**. Adding more buyers to a market that already has limited inventory will only push prices higher. That creates more debt and less equity for homeowners. To us, it feels like a short-term solution with long-term consequences that could financially entrap families.

**Instead of taking on 50 years of payments, we believe it’s better to get back to the basics**. Save consistently, reduce expenses, explore smaller or more affordable homes, and focus on steady financial growth. We also believe that local communities can help by supporting programs that buy down interest rates for essential workers, rather than extending loan terms.

Buying a home doesn’t have to mean taking on decades of extra debt. With thoughtful planning and the right guidance, you can find affordable options that build real equity and long-term stability.
