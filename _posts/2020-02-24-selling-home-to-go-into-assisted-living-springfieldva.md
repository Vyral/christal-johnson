Sometimes, all home sellers can see is their scenario, so I wanted to do a video series on different seller scenarios so that you can see how everyone's path is a little different, but we all have the same end goal in mind.

The seller we’re looking at today was in Springfield. The mother was transitioning to a nursing home, so the daughter and son-in-law hired us to sell their property and were referred by an agent in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

They needed to get as much money as possible for the sale to put toward their mother’s extended care at the nursing home. They wanted to do a whole lot of updates on the house, but we decided to focus on repairs instead. We wanted to make sure that when people stepped into the house, there wasn’t anything glaring that needed to be repaired. They also needed to sell by January 1.

Our pricing strategy was geared toward the facts that they needed to sell quickly and had taken really good care of the home. We priced aggressively to get the maximum money and the best terms. Pricing high won’t get you there in Northern Virginia. When your price aggressively, more eyes are on your property and you receive more offers. We are just about to close on this house for a good price.

I hope this shows you that every seller is different and no matter what your situation is, we can help. If you have any questions for us, feel free to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
