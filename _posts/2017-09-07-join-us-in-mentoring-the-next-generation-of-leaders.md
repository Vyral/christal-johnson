I’m joined today by Dr. Daria Groover, the principal of Featherstone Elementary School, and she has a special story to share.

As some of you may know, myself and some of the other members of our team like to volunteer our time mentoring some of the students at Featherstone. Public school teachers and administrators have tough job, but when she came to me and told me of the successes of one of our mentees, I just had to share with all of you. Here’s what Dr. Groover had to say:

“We have a student who is being mentored by Allen and some of the members on his team. This student hadn’t always been successful in the classroom in the past, but he has come a long way this year. He ended up passing two of his state standardized tests and when his teacher asked him what inspired him to get it together, his response was the mentoring program. That’s how we know the program is working and our students are meeting their goals.”

The time that we spend coming in and talking to these kids about responsibility, leadership, having pride, and setting goals is priceless. All of these things make a difference for students here at Featherstone.

We will be back next year, and we want you to join us in sharing your talents with the younger generation as well. If you have any questions about the program or want to get in touch with Dr. Groover, give us a call or send us an email. We are also always here to answer any real estate questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you.
