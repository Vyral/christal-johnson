If you’ve been following the Northern Virginia housing market, you’ve likely noticed that it’s not moving at the same pace everywhere. Some areas are slowing down, while others are still showing steady activity.

Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening in Prince William County and what the data means for buyers and sellers.

**Prince William County remains one of the more stable markets.** While places like Washington D.C., Falls Church City, Spotsylvania, and Culpeper are cooling off, Prince William County continues to perform well. Homes are still selling at a healthy pace, and prices are holding steady compared to other nearby markets. This makes the area one of the more balanced housing markets in Northern Virginia right now.

**More options for first-time buyers.** The biggest change this year is in the condo and townhome market. Active condo listings in Prince William County are up by 120%, and townhome listings are up by 62%. Condos are also selling for about $25,000 less than they were a year ago. For first-time buyers or anyone looking for an affordable option, this is a window of opportunity. More listings mean more choices, and lower prices can make homeownership more accessible.

**Single-family homes are staying strong.** One major reason for the county’s stability is the limited number of new homes being built. There are very few builders offering new single-family homes under $800,000 in Prince William County. In nearby areas like Stafford or Fauquier, builders are more active, which increases supply and puts pressure on resale prices. The lack of new construction in Prince William helps support resale values and keeps the market balanced.

**Other local markets are starting to shift.** Washington, D.C., is nearing a buyer’s market with almost six months of inventory. That means there are more homes for sale than active buyers. Political uncertainty has also made some buyers in the city more cautious. In places like Stafford, home prices could dip further because builders are offering strong incentives. Some are even buying down mortgage rates to 4.99%, making new homes more attractive despite higher list prices.

**Affordability could bring more stability.** As condos and townhomes in Prince William County become more affordable, more first-time buyers are entering the market. Increased activity in these lower price ranges tends to create upward movement in the single-family home market. When more buyers purchase entry-level homes, it encourages others to move up, keeping the local market healthy overall.

The current Prince William County market offers opportunities for both buyers and sellers, but success depends on understanding how to navigate the changes. Buyers can take advantage of increased listings and better prices, while sellers can benefit from steady demand and limited new construction. Knowing these key trends will help you make smart, confident decisions about your next move.
