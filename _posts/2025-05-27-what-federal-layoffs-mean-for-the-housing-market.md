Federal layoffs are making headlines, and we’ve been getting the same question again and again since January 21: “How will these job cuts and changes to government employment impact the DMV housing market?” We put this video together to talk about what we’re seeing on the ground, what it means for buyers and sellers, and how to make smart moves in uncertain times.

We also discuss why some homeowners are accelerating their plans to sell, how certain properties are more vulnerable than others, and why market corrections should not be confused with price crashes. Buyers are still active, but they’re taking a more cautious, long-term approach.

Don’t miss this opportunity to get ahead of the curve.
