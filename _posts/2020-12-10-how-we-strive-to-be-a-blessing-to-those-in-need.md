One of AJ Team Realty’s core values is “be a blessing.” This year, we’ve had to undergo a bit of a change when it comes to being a blessing to our community. We’re so used to being able to go to the schools and mentor students, and just generally address any needs as they’re presented.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned that one of our clients, Megan Radcliffe, had unfortunately passed away. She was a social worker in Manassas, and I would always call her around this time of year to ask her who we could bless. Megan would always get us a good list and hold us accountable for getting things done.

This year we reached out to one of Megan’s good friends Erin, a guidance counselor at a local high school. She helped us to identify 11 families, who we gave $100 gift cards from Wegmans to help them make a Thanksgiving dinner.

I woke up in the middle of the night recently thinking about these families, and I asked God to cover and provide for them. I heard Him speak to me in response: It wasn’t on Him to help them, but rather on us. I’m not just a person of prayer but also a person of action, and I thought these gift cards were just one way that we could really help those in need.

**You can also help us spread the love this season by [following this link](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2944951716670009718/6168883116832586423#){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where you can donate gift cards to people who need them**. If there’s a specific family you want to help, you’re more than welcome to do that, as well.

Reach out to us if you know of anyone who could use a little blessing this holiday season or if you have any questions. We’d love to hear from you.
