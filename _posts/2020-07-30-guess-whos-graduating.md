Today, we want everyone to join in on a special celebration:&nbsp;**Sam Eligwe, who’s been with our team for four years, is starting his own real estate venture.**&nbsp;It’s been amazing to watch Sam grow, and he’s enriched not just our team but our lives on a deeper level, too\! We’re thankful for his contributions to AJ Team Realty and the community, and we’re excited about what God will do for his business and his ministry.&nbsp;

Sometimes in life, we can miss the importance of letting people grow from us and find their next journey. We’ve had a lot of success together, but now it’s time for Sam to fly the nest and be the leader that God wants him to be.&nbsp;

**We can’t wait to see what’s in store for Sam, Maria, their girls, and everyone in their broader reach.&nbsp;**We’re thankful to have been a part of his journey, and though we’re sad to see him go, we know that this is the right move.

**Now, here’s a quick note for our clients**\: If you’re currently involved in any deals that include Sam, know that there will be no change to your transaction; you’ve likely already received a call from us explaining that nothing at all will feel different, and that your needs will continue to be met and your expectations will be exceeded.&nbsp;

It’s often said that the measure of a leader is reflected in the leaders they grow. Sam has pushed us to grow in many ways, and just because we’re not in business together anymore, it doesn’t mean that we’re not in life together. Congratulations, Sam\!&nbsp;

P.S. “Sam, I hope you know we'll still be competing on the basketball court. I was holding back a little since we worked together, but now it’s on\! Elbows will be flying.” — Allen.
