We believe it’s important to know your agent, so today we are excited to tell you about one of our amazing team members, Josh Davis. He is a senior buyer agent on our team and has been with us since 2019.&nbsp;

Some fun facts about Josh are that he was born in Japan and owns a motorcycle. If he could tell his younger self one thing, it would be to have more fun; life isn’t as serious as you think. He doesn’t drink, but loves pizza, especially with sausage and pepperoni\!&nbsp;

If he had to choose between living in a penthouse in Arlington or a mansion in Woodbridge, he would choose the latter. However, his wife and daughter love the beach, so he would also love to live there. If he could move anywhere outside of the DMV, he would move to Florida because he is a huge Dolphins fan.&nbsp;

**He says that the AJ team is great because of our family atmosphere.** Everyone in our team gets along, even the kids and families, and that means a lot to him.&nbsp;

With real estate, he loves that no day is the same as another. Each day is different, and it keeps him on his toes. He studied economics in college, so he loves crunching the numbers and making a deal work.&nbsp;

**Josh promises to take care of everyone’s money like it is his own.** He would never sell a house that he thinks the client wouldn’t love and adore, as that’s super important to him. He lives by the phrase “hustle, grind, and execution”, and he would love to hustle for you\!
