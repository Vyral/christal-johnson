It’s time for this summer’s annual backpack challenge.&nbsp;

This year, we’ll be donating pre-filled backpacks to children in need at a local homeless shelter as well as in local schools.&nbsp;

But we can’t do this alone. We’d love to have your help.

All you need to do is fill a backpack with school supplies such as erasers, pencils, crayons, and notebooks, and drop it off with us—we’ll take care of the rest.

For your convenience, we have two drop-off sites you can bring your donations to.&nbsp;

You can either drop off your pre-filled backpack at our office, which is located at 4310 Prince William Parkway, Suite 200, or with our cosponsors at the Frostie Moose—located at 12581 Milstead Way.

But that’s not all. As a way to thank you for your generosity, the Frostie Moose will be giving out coupons for free ice cream to anyone dropping off donations at their location.&nbsp;

Of course we all love ice cream, but we also love taking care of our community.&nbsp;

We’re excited for the opportunity to help kids in need, and we hope you’ll help us do so.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
