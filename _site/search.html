Here’s what it will entail and how you can register for it.Have you ever renovated a house to get it ready for sale? Do you know what you need to do to fix up, update, or repair your home before listing? Did you know that these decisions can either make or cost you thousands?When you’re selling a home and renovating it, the profit is made well before you put the sign in the yard or accept the contract. The problem is that most agents don’t have the necessary experience to advise you on what to renovate.While some sellers are worried about saving a percent or two on commission, smart sellers are preparing their home, making the correct renovations, and making thousands on their sale in profit.We’ve helped many home sellers like you make thousands of dollars by getting their homes market-ready. We have a really special seminar coming up that will help you do the same.“There are only 20 spots available, so register today.”Our FREE on-site renovation seminar will take you on a tour of a home that needs renovations from a to z. We’ll take you inside the strategy, the pricing, and the process of getting this home ready for the market and the decisions that will preserve your equity when you sell.There are only 20 spots available for this hands-on tour with us, our contractors, and all the information that you will need when you decide to sell.To register for one of our sessions, just follow this link. If you have any other questions about the seminar or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "Vyral Marketing",
        "category": "",
        "content": "As today’s story will demonstrate, it’s important to have a strategy when selling your home.Today I have a quick seller story to share with you to emphasize the importance of having a strategy in place when selling.This seller wanted to sell their Alexandria condo. It had been a good rental property for them for about 10 years, but they decided it was time to liquidate. When the seller originally came to me, they planned on selling the condo to their tenant. Although it took four weeks, I eventually convinced them that this would be a bad idea.After the tenant moved out, there was a decision to be made: Would we upgrade or keep the property in the same condition? After I had my contractors go through the property, we decided to make about $10,000 worth of updates over six weeks, including new paint, hardwood floors, granite countertops, and appliances.The client would’ve originally sold the home as is to their tenant for $195,000, but with these upgrades, we sold for $218,000—a difference of $23,000. As a homeowner, if I were to tell you that a $10,000 investment would return $23,000, I bet you’d take that deal every day of the week.This is the type of process we take all our sellers through. If you’re looking to net as much money as you can from your home sale, we can put together a strategy to get the highest return on your investment.“If I were to tell you that a $10,000 investment would return $23,000, I bet you’d take that deal every day of the week.”If you’re thinking of putting your home on the market and you need a selling strategy to maximize your return, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. Remember—you have the dream, we have the address.",

        "author": "Vyral Marketing",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To increase your referral business, it’s important that you know how to properly pass them on. Here are four tips to keep in mind.Today Sam Eligwe is here with me to talk about a subject that’s very important for anyone in business: How to properly pass a referral. We’ve found four great tips that make passing that referral even easier, and we’re excited to share them with you today:1. Only refer those whom you believe in. You only have one chance to get it right. You’re not just passing off a referral, you’re passing off your integrity, your judgment, and a lot of other things. If you are going to refer someone, make sure you get it right. The only way to get it right is with past experience. Identify a few things that you like about someone’s professional skills after you work with them that you can tell to referrals.“Your confidence in the referral should speak for itself.”2. Look at what other business this referral has. Not only is your experience important, but so is the experience of others who have worked with this person in the past.3. You don’t have to sell them. Your confidence in your referral should speak for itself.4. Make the connection and let them handle their business. Refer the business, and then you can step back and let things happen. Making that first contact is huge and gives your referral a much better shot of working with them. Word of mouth is huge for small businesses, so these referrals are very important.Passing referrals off the right way is so important in our line of work. You can literally change businesses by referring the right way. If you have a referral for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. If you have any other questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Alex Argueta is a wonderful buyer specialist on the AJ Team, and he recently sat down to answer a few questions so we can all get to know him a little better.I’m delighted to be joined by Alex Argueta today. Alex is one of the great agents we have here on the AJ Team. I asked him a few questions about his journey, his career, and his hopes for the future, which he answered in the video above. Here are some of the highlights:What one thing have you learned in your first full year in real estate?To be successful in this business, you have to be full-time. Second of all, you have to put in the work. This isn’t just a job; it’s a lifestyle. You always have to be on and always have to study the market because it’s constantly shifting. Staying on top of it is key.What advice do you have for homebuyers in the area?If you’re planning on buying, don’t wait until the last minute to start trying to get prepared. Some people are lucky enough to find a new home within a month of starting their search, but others can take over a year to find the perfect fit. It mostly depends on where you’re looking and your budget. Knowing those things is key.“I’m always going to fight for my clients like they’re my family.”Why should you use Alex as a real estate agent?Mainly because of the knowledge I’ve gained working here on the AJ Team. I have so much knowledge that I can share, and my main objective is to help a family obtain their ultimate dream of buying a house. I’m always going to fight for everyone like they’re my family, whether it’s someone I just met or whether it is my actual family. I’ll work 100% to make sure we can help you in the best way possible.Pase a las 2:55 para escuchar la respuesta en españolIf you have any questions for him in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give Alex a call at 703-991-7922.

        "content": "The latest numbers make now a great time to be a buyer in our market.The latest market numbers from September have been released—what do they indicate about our DMV marketplace? That’s a question on a lot of people’s minds right now because the numbers from the previous month reflected a slower market than what we’re used to.Here are the key year-over-year September numbers you need to know from our area:  • Prince William County: Closed sales dropped 24%, and the average sold price dropped 0.7%  • Fairfax County: Closed sales dropped 19.8%, and the average sold price dropped 1.7%  • Prince Georges County: Closed sales dropped 5.9%, but the average sold price rose 2.4%  • Washington, DC: Closed sales dropped 24.8%, and the average sold price dropped 2.2%  • Arlington County: Closed sales dropped 23.1%, but the average sold price rose 0.3%  • Loudoun County: closed sales dropped 16.2%, and the average sold price dropped 0.9%  • These stats are a good indication of the trends we’re seeing industry-wide. As you can see, conditions aren’t very robust at the moment, even though interest rates are extremely low. The  • last time they were this low, people were itching to buy homes. This isn’t to say our market is heading for a crash—it’s just adjusting, which means your real estate plans must adjust as well.If you’re a buyer, now’s the perfect time to make your move. Prices have pulled back and, as I mentioned above, interest rates are in the 3% range. These low rates impact you more than prices. If you can get cheap money, go and get it! If you’re a first-time homebuyer, the likelihood of your being able to afford closing costs is much higher. If you’re a move-up buyer who needs to sell your lower-priced home first, you won’t take as big of a loss selling your home as you think.If you’re a seller, the best way to get full market value for your home is to price it appropriately right out of the gate. If you start chasing the market down, you don’t know where your bottom will show up. If you wait an extra month or two to get another $10,000, that sum may never appear.“Conditions aren’t very robust at the moment, even though interest rates are extremely low”Also, make sure you show your home correctly. Many buyers have come to me recently asking me to help fix up their home properly because they listed it beforehand with another agent but followed some bad advice in terms of how to show it. If you show your home correctly, you’ll sell quicker and for a higher price.If you’d like to talk more about our DMV market or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Why did I choose real estate? Let me share the story of how I got into real estate.To explain what makes the AJ Team who we are, I’ll share my own story of how and why I got into real estate.We’ll start with my graduation from George Mason University in 1999. My degree was in English literature, but my first job out of college was at a used car dealership in Fairfax. My dad was happy I landed a sales job. My mom was less so considering I just completed an English literature degree and she assumed my career path would start elsewhere, but God has a way of positioning us in places we need to be.Two years later, my dad suggested it was time for me to buy a house. You see, his graduation present to me was $5,000 to put toward buying my first house. At the time, I was doing well at the dealership, and because I worked a lot and didn’t have time to spend a lot, I had enough money saved up.During my first weekend checking out open houses, though, no one would talk to me. This was the early 2000s, and I had Allen Iverson cornrows and was wearing baggy sweatpants because it was my day off. I didn’t look like a typical buyer, and I wasn’t treated like a typical buyer. Next week I told my dad what happened and said it was a sign that I should stay where I was at.“At this point, it feels more like family.”He disagreed, and when the next weekend came around, he went with me to check out open houses. As you can imagine, most of the agents talked to him instead of me. At the last house we visited, though, the listing agent (who looked like my aunt) we talked to said I reminded her of her son, and that she’d love to help me buy my first house.However, when I showed up at her office on my next day off, she stood me up. I called my dad and tried telling him again that it was a sign not to buy. The next day at work, the first person who walked into our lot was a young man named Lydio. He ended up deciding to buy a Mazda 626, and when I saw his loan application, I noticed that he wrote “real estate agent” as his job.That’s when I told Lydio I would buy a house with him, and three months later, I did. In those three months, I also obtained my real estate license. I had a bunch of friends graduating college at the time, and I didn’t want them to go through what I went through. I wanted them to be treated right—to have a Realtor that they could grow with, helped them understand the market, and do right by them regardless of how they looked.18 years later, I’ve sold over 1,200 homes, and I’ve had the pleasure of helping so many people buy their first home. At this point, it feels more like family.As always, if you have any real estate needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.",

        "author": "Vyral Marketing",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How do you sell your home and buy a new one at the same time? Find out today.When it comes to selling your current home and buying a new one at the same time, there are three key points to think about: planning, committing, and executing.1. Plan. Your plan should start at least four to six months in advance. Starting the process early will save you a lot of stress. Also, communication is crucial during the process. We like to coordinate with our clients months in advance so that we can make sure that they’re on the right path and that we have a solid game plan. Planning ahead will give you plenty of time to prepare your home for the market, as well; you never know when the perfect home is going to come on the market. Be ready at all times.2. Commit. Juggling both transactions on top of everything else in your life is stressful, so you need to commit. The good news is that we help two or three families buy and sell at the same time each month, so you can lean on us for help. Part of committing to the process is being educated about the process to come. When clients we work with don’t expect what’s coming, it hits them by surprise and they get frustrated.“Throughout the process, we may tell you some things you may not want to hear, but trust the process and remember that we only have your best interests at heart.”3. Execute. Make sure that you understand the contract. For our part, we sit down with our clients to explain the contingencies of the contract and write out the full plan.  Throughout the process, we may tell you some things you may not want to hear, but trust the process and remember that we only have your best interests at heart. Additionally, think about why you’re moving—when I last moved, it was because we had a baby on the way and we needed more space; that made all the stress we went through worth it.If you’re planning to sell and buy a home, reach out to us as soon as possible so that we can start forming a game plan. For any questions you have, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email. Hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "Are you considering refinancing your mortgage? Here are a few things you’ll need to take into account first.We’ve been getting a bunch of questions recently about refinancing and whether it’s a smart move in our current market. Here are a few things you should think about if you’re experiencing the same dilemma.For starters, if you’re going to consolidate some type of high-interest debt, refinancing makes a lot of sense because you can lock that debt into a much lower interest rate. That can save you a ton of money.If you are currently in an adjustable-rate mortgage and it’s about to expire over the next year or two, it might be a good idea to refinance to a fixed rate before that adjustable rate skyrockets.Another thing you’ll need to think about is the terms of your loan. Let’s say that you’ve been paying your mortgage down for the next seven years and you go to refinance. Typically, if you go to refinance for another 30 years, you’re basically extending the life that you’re paying for your loan by another seven years. For some people, that is advantageous and for others it’s not. You have to think about where you are in your life.“Now is a great time to refinance, pull out your equity, and make another investment.”For example, we had a client who needed more cash flow from their property because they had a child going to college. They decided to extend their mortgage out so they could keep more of their cash and use those funds for college. Don’t just think about terms on one side. Think about them in the totality of where your life is and where you should have your cash.If you’re a real estate investor, right now is a great time for you to take out a home equity line of credit, refinance, and pull out money to buy another investment property.These are just a few of the things you’ll need to think about when refinancing. If you have any questions for me about the process or what you should do in your situation, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. If you have a rate over 4.5%, we should be talking. I hope to hear from you soon.",

        "author": "Vyral Marketing",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Beware these three deal killers both before and during the home selling process.Recently, I spoke with someone from one of our local title companies. During our conversation, he said something that was pretty eye-opening: 15% to 18% of home sales collapse after going under contract.To put that into perspective, that means that out of 100 deals, somewhere between 15 and 18 of them will fall apart. To prevent your deal from suffering the same fate, today I’ll list three “deal-killers” that you should avoid.The first deal-killer on the list is not working with an experienced agent. Certain factors make our Lake Ridge market challenging and unique, and agents who are still new to the business suffer from inexperience that makes it difficult for them to successfully navigate through challenges that arise. It’s best to work with an agent or team that has years of experience and plenty of sales volume under their belts like the Allen Johnson Team.“15% to 18% of home sales collapse after going under contract.”Other sellers make mistakes related to timing, preparing, pricing, and relationships.• Timing. Presenting news to your buyer and their agent and negotiating in a timely way are essential to the success of your sale. • Prep. Make sure you’re crossing your t’s and dotting your i’s ahead of each stage in the selling process. That means making preparations before you list your home, making sure inspections are complete, and making sure you reach the settlement table. • Pricing. Your pricing strategy can either make or break your sale. If you price correctly from the start, challenges that may arise will be much easier to address. • Relationships. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve been able to salvage a deal based on a strong relationship we had with the agent on the other side. When agents collaborate well together, deals get done. It’s that simple.The last deal killer is sort of a combination of the first two. To illustrate my point, let me share a quick story. We listed a home in Westridge that contained poly pipes, which is normal for certain homes in this area. The buyer’s agent was actually from Alexandria and was totally unfamiliar with poly pipes.As a result, they wrongly informed the buyer that replacing the pipes would cost anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000. In reality, we got them replaced for closer to $5,000, which made all the difference in keeping the deal alive.If you have any questions or you’re thinking about selling your Lake Ridge home, please give us a call. We’d love to sit down and speak with you!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "According to the latest numbers, the market is pulling back on sellers, and now is a great time to be a buyer.What’s the latest news from our Northern Virginia market? Let’s take a look at some key statistics from July to find out.July is typically a very busy month in our market, and we expect about 40% of all listed homes to sell during summer. In Prince William County, though, the number of home sales didn’t increase at all compared to last year. However, this is good news considering this number decreased the previous month compared to 2018. The average sold price in Prince William County, meanwhile, dropped almost 2% month over month, and the average days on market increased 5.6% during that same time.In Fairfax County, the number of closed sales dropped 4.8% month over month, the average sold price dropped 1.1%, and the average days on market rose 6.5%. You usually don’t see the average days on market increase during this time, so sellers need to realize right about now that the market is pulling back.Another tell-tale sign of this is the numbers from Alexandria City. A couple of months back, a lot of people predicted our market would go crazy because of Amazon moving their second headquarters here, but I told people that would only happen in a small area for a short time. Sure enough, closed sales in Alexandria City are down 17% year over year, the average sold price is down 3.4% month over month, and the average days on market is up 8.7% compared to June.“If you’re a buyer, these numbers mean now is go time.”In Arlington County, closed sales dropped 9.5% year over year, and the average sold price dropped 7.2% month over month. The good news here, though, is that the average days on market dropped 16.7% compared to the previous month.Stafford County is an intriguing case in terms of home values: Month over month, closed sales rose 11.2%, the average sold price rose 0.4%, and the average days on market dropped 3.7%.Lastly, in Loudoun County, it’s the same story as most of the other counties—closed sales are down 1.2%, the average sold price is down 1.4%, and the average days on market is up 22.6% month over month.If you’re a buyer, these numbers mean now is go time, especially considering that interest rates are in the 3% range for owner-occupied properties and in 4% range for investment properties. If you’re a seller, since we already know the market is pulling pack, you need to prep your home accordingly and price it correctly from the first day you list it. You also need to make sure you hire the right agent—roughly 85% of all agents in our market have never sold a home in a “down” market.If you have any more questions about our market or you’re ready to buy or sell now, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. These are waters we’ve navigated before, and we’d love to help you do so too. Remember: You have the dream, we have the address.",

Stay tuned!Here are the latest numbers we’ve seen in the Lake Ridge market as of June 2019:The 105 closed sales from June this year were down 16% over last year, which was a concerning number. However, that figure was an 8.3% increase over May of 2019, so they’re on the rise.The June median sold price ($340,000) was down by 1.7% year over year, and the average sold price ($368,723) was down by 3.5% over last year.“Sellers need to concentrate on not only timing when they put their home on the market, but also when they stage, renovate, and repair their homes.”The average days on market for June (31 days) was down by 31.1% over June 2018, and down by 11.4% over May 2019. This directly correlates with the increased number of month-to-month closed sales in the first statistic; when the days on the market goes down, the more sales you tend to see. Sellers need to concentrate on not only timing when they put their home on the market, but also when they stage, renovate, and repair their homes. Talk to your real estate professional well in advance of listing your home on the market.For homebuyers thinking of purchasing a home in our market, know that interest rates are way lower than anyone anticipated even two or three years ago. These low rates aren’t going to be around forever, so make sure you take advantage of them while they’re here.If you have any questions about buying or selling in the Lake Ridge area, reach out to us.

        "content": "Will Amazon affect your Lakeridge home’s value? Today I’ll discuss what you need to know.The subject of Amazon’s impact on home values is one I’ve talked about for the better part of 18months. Everyone has their own views, but I believe that the data will truly show us what’s going on.The stats from May are officially out, so we can take a look at the numbers from the market tosee how the news about Amazon’s headquarters impacted real estate. The news broke aboutthree months ago, meaning any impact should be reflected in the numbers; remember that real estatedoes react to news.Throughout the month of May 2019 in Prince William County, we saw some good growth.The average sold price rose year over year by almost 4% up to $417, 796, which is great! That’salmost $8,000 in equity gained.Similarly, the number of units sold rose as well, increasing by 10% year over year from 768 inMay 2018 to 845 in May 2019. This was also pushed by a lot of new developments in the area.The number of active listings did drop in the year between May 2018 and May 2019—overall, therewas a 16.8% drop. Sellers need to realize that we’re in the last part of a hyper seller’s market; we’resteadily shifting towards a more balanced market. So, if you’re thinking about selling your home,this is the atmosphere in which you should make your move, especially if you want to get all themoney you can from the sale.Now, the Greater Lakeridge Area hasn’t seen the growth that the larger Prince William County areahas seen. We often talk about real estate being a hyperlocal market, meaning that even within asingle county, different areas can experience different trends. The average sold price in Lakeridgeincreased by less than 1% in the last year, and the number of units sold dropped by almost20%. The number of active listings in Lakeridge, on the other hand, jumped from 130 in May 2018 to140 in May 2019, which is a 7.69% increase.To understand how, if at all, Amazon’s headquarters will affect the local market, let’s take a look atthe stats from Arlington County:• The average sold price went from $666,802 last year to $713,223 this year—a 6.96% increase.• The number of active listings fell from 524 to just 268—a 48.85% drop.So when people ask me how Amazon’s news has impacted Lakeridge, I’ll tell them that ithasn’t, and the numbers have already proven it.However, Amazon will affect the area directly around the new headquarters site, which is the CrystalCity corridor that encompasses Arlington and Alexandria. So if you’re waiting for Amazon to changeyour Lakeridge home’s value, don’t hold your breath.If you’d like to dive a little deeper into the numbers, or if you have any questions, don’t hesitate toreach out to me.

        "content": "If you’re wondering what our Lake Ridge market has been up to lately, we have a few year-over-year stats from last May that will give you the full scoop.Starting at 0:25 in the video above, you can see the numbers for yourself as we look over our monthly market report.The first stat to know is the average sold price, which rose by just 0.71%. The year before, it rose by nearly 4% compared to 2017. Lake Ridge isn’t a place where you’ll see wide variations in the market, which makes it a safe place for investors and regular homebuyers.The second is the number of units sold, which dropped by 17%. This means we’re seeing activity lessen. If you’re thinking of selling, you need to be aware of how you price your home, what other homes are on the market, and what kind of activity they’re seeing. This 17% drop in units sold is mirrored by another 17% drop that occurred in terms of the total dollar volume of sales, which includes both detached homes and condos and townhomes.“In short, we predicted the market would slow down, and it has.”Another interesting thing to note is the type of financing that’s being used by homebuyers. During the month of May, of the nearly 100 total home sales, 50 of the buyers used a conventional loan, which is more than the total number of FHA (18) and VA (20) loans combined. When I first started my real estate career here 17 years ago, far more buyers were using FHA and VA loans. Essentially, this means buyers are a lot more qualified and have a lot more cash to put into their homes.Whether you’re buying or selling, these are the numbers you need to be aware of if you want to put yourself in a position to get the best deal possible. If you have any questions about our market or you’d like to get started with the home buying or home selling process, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.Remember: You have the dream—we have the address.",

And when the marketchanges, we can’t expect the same old strategies to continue working well.We’re getting the same question from sellers lately: Should I price my home high from theoutset and simply lower it if needed?If you don’t price your home correctly from the beginning, you can never get back once you startmaking reductions. It’s a huge gamble that, more often than not, loses you both time and money.We had a client who wanted to sell their home for $550,000, but we knew it was worth closer to$525,000. They decided to try it at their price for around a month and a half. After it sat on themarket without an offer, they lowered it to our original recommendation—but the market didn’trespond. They had to lower it by an additional $10,000 before it would sell.When you price your home too high, there’s a very short window to change it. If you miss thatwindow, you have to figure out what the new “normal” is, and it’s likely far below what you couldhave gotten in the first place.Price it right from the beginning—don’t base it off what your neighbor’s home sold for or otherrandom advice you’ve heard. We go a few layers deep, looking at comparable sales, under-contracthomes, active listings, and much more. After looking at all of these trends, we can get a clearpicture of what your home should be priced at.If you are looking to sell your home, have any questions, or need more information, feel free toreach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "There are several vital steps you need to take if you’re looking to sell your home priced under $400,000.What’s the difference between selling a home under $400,000 and selling a home that’s over $400,000?In our market, the $400,000 price-range is the price point for a first time homebuyer. When you’re sellinga home to a first time homebuyer, there are certain steps you need to take to ensure a successful sale.Understanding the psychology of a first-time buyer is crucial for getting top dollar for your home. Mostfirst time homebuyers are nervous about their upcoming purchase, so here are a few tips to help makethe buyer comfortable and ensure a smooth transaction.1. Make sure that your home is easily accessible. We understand that you may be busy, but most firsttime homebuyers cannot visit the property at the drop of a hat, so being available when the buyer isready is key.2. Price your home right. Today’s buyers have access to all types of information. If your home isn’t pricedright, or even perceived as priced right, it’s not going to sell. If you are priced a little high, be sure to adjustfast. If you do not receive offers within two weeks, you need to consider lowering the list price.3. Make simple repairs. First-time homebuyers are what I like to call “HGTV buyers”, meaning they don’tknow how to make simple repairs or don’t understand the costs involved. A quick internet search forthese services can result in worst case scenarios, which will scare buyers away. Don’t leave anythingto the imagination.4. Remodel for your buyer’s taste, not your own. Do some research to find out what other sellers havedone to their homes, and mimic that. Don’t remodel your home based on what you like, as future buyersmay not have the same taste.Going through these steps will help ensure a smooth sale to an often nervous first-time homebuyer.If you have any further questions or you think you’re ready to start the process of selling your house,give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you!",
