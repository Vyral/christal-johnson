        <title>Onsite Renovation Seminar Saturday Feb 1st - Limited Space available </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQtwb8gDx3c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious about what you can do to help your home sell for top dollar, our upcoming renovation seminar will be a huge help. Here’s what it will entail and how you can register for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever renovated a house to get it ready for sale? Do you know what you need to do to fix up, update, or repair your home before listing? Did you know that these decisions can either make or cost you thousands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re selling a home and renovating it, the profit is made well before you put the sign in the yard or accept the contract. The problem is that most agents don’t have the necessary experience to advise you on what to renovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some sellers are worried about saving a percent or two on commission, smart sellers are preparing their home, making the correct renovations, and making thousands on their sale in profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve helped many home sellers like you make thousands of dollars by getting their homes market-ready. We have a really special seminar coming up that will help you do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are only 20 spots available, so register today.%20http://localhost:4000/our-renovation-seminar-will-give-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are only 20 spots available, so register today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our FREE on-site renovation seminar will take you on a tour of a home that needs renovations from a to z. We’ll take you inside the strategy, the pricing, and the process of getting this home ready for the market and the decisions that will preserve your equity when you sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only 20 spots available for this hands-on tour with us, our contractors, and all the information that you will need when you decide to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To register for one of our sessions, just follow this link. If you have any other questions about the seminar or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How We Added $23,000 to Our Clients Condo Sale </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuWqeu6198I?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As today’s story will demonstrate, it’s important to have a strategy when selling your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I have a quick seller story to share with you to emphasize the importance of having a strategy in place when selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seller wanted to sell their Alexandria condo. It had been a good rental property for them for about 10 years, but they decided it was time to liquidate. When the seller originally came to me, they planned on selling the condo to their tenant. Although it took four weeks, I eventually convinced them that this would be a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tenant moved out, there was a decision to be made: Would we upgrade or keep the property in the same condition? After I had my contractors go through the property, we decided to make about $10,000 worth of updates over six weeks, including new paint, hardwood floors, granite countertops, and appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client would’ve originally sold the home as is to their tenant for $195,000, but with these upgrades, we sold for $218,000—a difference of $23,000. As a homeowner, if I were to tell you that a $10,000 investment would return $23,000, I bet you’d take that deal every day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the type of process we take all our sellers through. If you’re looking to net as much money as you can from your home sale, we can put together a strategy to get the highest return on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If I were to tell you that a $10,000 investment would return $23,000, I bet you’d take that deal every day of the week.%20http://localhost:4000/how-we-added-23000-to-our-clients-condo.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If I were to tell you that a $10,000 investment would return $23,000, I bet you’d take that deal every day of the week.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of putting your home on the market and you need a selling strategy to maximize your return, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. Remember—you have the dream, we have the address.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Pass A Referral 101</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0c3g7_JxUZE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase your referral business, it’s important that you know how to properly pass them on. Here are four tips to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Sam Eligwe is here with me to talk about a subject that’s very important for anyone in business: How to properly pass a referral. We’ve found four great tips that make passing that referral even easier, and we’re excited to share them with you today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Only refer those whom you believe in.&lt;/strong&gt; You only have one chance to get it right. You’re not just passing off a referral, you’re passing off your integrity, your judgment, and a lot of other things. If you are going to refer someone, make sure you get it right. The only way to get it right is with past experience. Identify a few things that you like about someone’s professional skills after you work with them that you can tell to referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Your confidence in the referral should speak for itself.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-properly-pass-on-referral.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Your confidence in the referral should speak for itself.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Look at what other business this referral has.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only is your experience important, but so is the experience of others who have worked with this person in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You don’t have to sell them.&lt;/strong&gt; Your confidence in your referral should speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make the connection and let them handle their business.&lt;/strong&gt; Refer the business, and then you can step back and let things happen. Making that first contact is huge and gives your referral a much better shot of working with them. Word of mouth is huge for small businesses, so these referrals are very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing referrals off the right way is so important in our line of work. You can literally change businesses by referring the right way. If you have a referral for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. If you have any other questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Quick Q&amp;A With Alex Argueta</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2h8hD-g7fQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Argueta is a wonderful buyer specialist on the AJ Team, and he recently sat down to answer a few questions so we can all get to know him a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be joined by Alex Argueta today. Alex is one of the great agents we have here on the AJ Team. I asked him a few questions about his journey, his career, and his hopes for the future, which he answered in the video above. Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What one thing have you learned in your first full year in real estate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful in this business, you have to be full-time. Second of all, you have to put in the work. This isn’t just a job; it’s a lifestyle. You always have to be on and always have to study the market because it’s constantly shifting. Staying on top of it is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What advice do you have for homebuyers in the area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning on buying, don’t wait until the last minute to start trying to get prepared. Some people are lucky enough to find a new home within a month of starting their search, but others can take over a year to find the perfect fit. It mostly depends on where you’re looking and your budget. Knowing those things is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I’m always going to fight for my clients like they’re my family.%20http://localhost:4000/a-quick-q-with-alex-argueta.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I’m always going to fight for my clients like they’re my family.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you use Alex as a real estate agent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly because of the knowledge I’ve gained working here on the AJ Team. I have so much knowledge that I can share, and my main objective is to help a family obtain their ultimate dream of buying a house. I’m always going to fight for everyone like they’re my family, whether it’s someone I just met or whether it is my actual family. I’ll work 100% to make sure we can help you in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pase a las 2:55 para escuchar la respuesta en español&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for him in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give Alex a call at 703-991-7922. We can’t wait to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Love and Real Estate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQgGdg2UJ2U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re sitting down to be interviewed about how we make it work: being married and also working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re discussing love and real estate. Christal and Allen Johnson have been married for 11 years. Christal has learned over the years that Allen will keep pushing her out of her comfort zone and “I’ll take that as a great sign that our relationship continues to grow.” Allen has come to realize that love evolves, that there are a lot of different phases of love, and “I feel every year our love gets more dynamic.” Today Christal and Allen are being interviewed about what it’s like to work together in real estate as a married couple. There are specific challenges and advantages to this type of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:05: Introduction to today’s topic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:50: The first real estate transaction Christal and Allen handled as a couple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:40: Real estate when they began versus now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:15: How their relationship relates to their business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:45: How Christal and Allen balance who they are as individuals with how they work together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14:15: Where they see the AJ Team going in the future&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19:50: How to contact Christal and Allen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have further questions about this topic or any other relating to real estate, please give the AJ Team a call or send us an email. We would love to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fall Housing Market Report #DMV</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3gTyCoRRRg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest numbers make now a great time to be a buyer in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest market numbers from September have been released—what do they indicate about our DMV marketplace? That’s a question on a lot of people’s minds right now because the numbers from the previous month reflected a slower market than what we’re used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the key year-over-year September numbers you need to know from our area:
  • Prince William County: Closed sales dropped 24%, and the average sold price dropped 0.7%
  • Fairfax County: Closed sales dropped 19.8%, and the average sold price dropped 1.7%
  • Prince Georges County: Closed sales dropped 5.9%, but the average sold price rose 2.4%
  • Washington, DC: Closed sales dropped 24.8%, and the average sold price dropped 2.2%
  • Arlington County: Closed sales dropped 23.1%, but the average sold price rose 0.3%
  • Loudoun County: closed sales dropped 16.2%, and the average sold price dropped 0.9%
  • These stats are a good indication of the trends we’re seeing industry-wide. As you can see, conditions aren’t very robust at the moment, even though interest rates are extremely low. The  • last time they were this low, people were itching to buy homes. This isn’t to say our market is heading for a crash—it’s just adjusting, which means your real estate plans must adjust as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer, now’s the perfect time to make your move. Prices have pulled back and, as I mentioned above, interest rates are in the 3% range. These low rates impact you more than prices. If you can get cheap money, go and get it! If you’re a first-time homebuyer, the likelihood of your being able to afford closing costs is much higher. If you’re a move-up buyer who needs to sell your lower-priced home first, you won’t take as big of a loss selling your home as you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller, the best way to get full market value for your home is to price it appropriately right out of the gate. If you start chasing the market down, you don’t know where your bottom will show up. If you wait an extra month or two to get another $10,000, that sum may never appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Conditions aren’t very robust at the moment, even though interest rates are extremely low%20http://localhost:4000/the-latest-numbers-make-now-great-time.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Conditions aren’t very robust at the moment, even though interest rates are extremely low”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure you show your home correctly. Many buyers have come to me recently asking me to help fix up their home properly because they listed it beforehand with another agent but followed some bad advice in terms of how to show it. If you show your home correctly, you’ll sell quicker and for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to talk more about our DMV market or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Howand WhyI Got Into Real Estate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2l0f16b3fA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I choose real estate? Let me share the story of how I got into real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain what makes the AJ Team who we are, I’ll share my own story of how and why I got into real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with my graduation from George Mason University in 1999. My degree was in English literature, but my first job out of college was at a used car dealership in Fairfax. My dad was happy I landed a sales job. My mom was less so considering I just completed an English literature degree and she assumed my career path would start elsewhere, but God has a way of positioning us in places we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, my dad suggested it was time for me to buy a house. You see, his graduation present to me was $5,000 to put toward buying my first house. At the time, I was doing well at the dealership, and because I worked a lot and didn’t have time to spend a lot, I had enough money saved up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first weekend checking out open houses, though, no one would talk to me. This was the early 2000s, and I had Allen Iverson cornrows and was wearing baggy sweatpants because it was my day off. I didn’t look like a typical buyer, and I wasn’t treated like a typical buyer. Next week I told my dad what happened and said it was a sign that I should stay where I was at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=At this point, it feels more like family.%20http://localhost:4000/howand-whyi-got-into-real-estate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“At this point, it feels more like family.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He disagreed, and when the next weekend came around, he went with me to check out open houses. As you can imagine, most of the agents talked to him instead of me. At the last house we visited, though, the listing agent (who looked like my aunt) we talked to said I reminded her of her son, and that she’d love to help me buy my first house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I showed up at her office on my next day off, she stood me up. I called my dad and tried telling him again that it was a sign not to buy. The next day at work, the first person who walked into our lot was a young man named Lydio. He ended up deciding to buy a Mazda 626, and when I saw his loan application, I noticed that he wrote “real estate agent” as his job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I told Lydio I would buy a house with him, and three months later, I did. In those three months, I also obtained my real estate license. I had a bunch of friends graduating college at the time, and I didn’t want them to go through what I went through. I wanted them to be treated right—to have a Realtor that they could grow with, helped them understand the market, and do right by them regardless of how they looked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18 years later, I’ve sold over 1,200 homes, and I’ve had the pleasure of helping so many people buy their first home. At this point, it feels more like family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any real estate needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Key Points to Help You Buy &amp; Sell at the Same Time</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTHNhJqfQDo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you sell your home and buy a new one at the same time? Find out today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to selling your current home and buying a new one at the same time, there are three key points to think about: planning, committing, and executing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Your plan should start at least four to six months in advance. Starting the process early will save you a lot of stress. Also, communication is crucial during the process. We like to coordinate with our clients months in advance so that we can make sure that they’re on the right path and that we have a solid game plan. Planning ahead will give you plenty of time to prepare your home for the market, as well; you never know when the perfect home is going to come on the market. Be ready at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Commit.&lt;/strong&gt; Juggling both transactions on top of everything else in your life is stressful, so you need to commit. The good news is that we help two or three families buy and sell at the same time each month, so you can lean on us for help. Part of committing to the process is being educated about the process to come. When clients we work with don’t expect what’s coming, it hits them by surprise and they get frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Throughout the process, we may tell you some things you may not want to hear, but trust the process and remember that we only have your best interests at heart.%20http://localhost:4000/how-do-you-sell-your-home-and-buy-new.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Throughout the process, we may tell you some things you may not want to hear, but trust the process and remember that we only have your best interests at heart.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Execute.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure that you understand the contract. For our part, we sit down with our clients to explain the contingencies of the contract and write out the full plan.  Throughout the process, we may tell you some things you may not want to hear, but trust the process and remember that we only have your best interests at heart. Additionally, think about why you’re moving—when I last moved, it was because we had a baby on the way and we needed more space; that made all the stress we went through worth it.
If you’re planning to sell and buy a home, reach out to us as soon as possible so that we can start forming a game plan. For any questions you have, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email. Hope to hear from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
