<div style="text-align: center;"><i>Now is one of the best times in the last five or six years to invest in a home purchase in Northern Virginia. Here’s why.</i></div><br />Today we are only going to talk about one thing, buying and holding. In other words, real estate property investment. I think this is the season to do it for many reasons.<br /><br />If you’re looking to buy and flip a home, that time has passed. However, <b>right now is arguably one of the best times in the last five or six years to buy an investment property in Northern Virginia</b> for a few reasons. Here they are:<br /><br /><b>1. Money is cheap. </b>I recently bought an investment property with a rate under 4.5%. If you look at rates historically, they have never really been this low for investment properties. I’ve seen cheap rates across the board. When you’re buying and holding, the rate is even more important than the price. If you’re holding a property long-term, your tenant/s will be paying that down over time anyways.<br /><b><br /></b><b>2. Winter offers and winter sellers.</b> Winter offers tend to be a little bit more aggressive and winter sellers tend to be a little bit more desperate when selling. Right now, there are investors out there that have to move properties in order to get another property or to liquidate assets. This plays to your advantage as well.<br /><b><br /></b><b>3. The options you have. </b>What kind of property should you buy? It all depends on your situation. I’m a hands-on landlord, so I like to invest in townhomes and multi-family properties. However, your plan may be completely different. You should sit down with someone, like us, who can help you determine what your situation is and what your goals are.<br /><br /><b>4. Cash on cash return. </b>How much do you want to get back from your investment? We can sit down with you and calculate that number. The rule of thumb with me is to look at the rate of return you can get through investing in real estate vs. the rate of return you get from your bank. When you put your money into a CD or mutual account, you might only get a 1% or 2% rate of return. With investment properties, however, I’m seeing a 7% to 8% cash on cash return with regularity in Northern Virginia. In addition to those returns, you have appreciation. That raises your cash on cash return even higher.<br /><br />If you have money sitting around somewhere and it’s not getting the return you want, you would be foolish not to look at real estate investing here in Northern Virginia. We just settled a deal yesterday for one of our clients who bought his 10th property with the AJ Team. He has reaped the benefits greatly.<br /><br />If you or someone you know is thinking about investing, give us a call or send us an email. We want to help you build your wealth.<br /><div><br /></div>
